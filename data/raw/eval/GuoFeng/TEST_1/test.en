Chapter 55 - Serial Number 27149
“Is my identity exposed now that I’m on the Wanted Players list?” Gu Fei asked.
“It isn’t as long as you don’t get caught,” Brother Assist answered.
“Won’t my name be revealed?” Gu Fei asked.
“No,” Brother Assist shook his head, “The people on the list are assigned a serial number each. Right now, you’re probably displayed as fugitive serial number XXXXX on the list.”
“So that’s how it is....”
“Players who accept the ‘Bounty Mission’ will have your location updated on their quest log every five minutes. You just have to calculate the interval properly and move every five minutes, and the players won’t find you easily,” Brother Assist said.
“That makes sense! I’ll get moving, then!” Gu Fei checked the time and saw that he was approaching the five-minute mark since he got online.
“What do you want to buy? I’ll buy it for you,” Brother Assist walked toward the touchscreen interface of the Auction House.
“Okay. Get me an appropriate level 30 mage robe, as well as a necklace, ring, and emblem that increase the proc rate of a weapon’s fire attack,” Gu Fei said.
Brother Assist distanced himself from the interface while saying, “It’s about time. You should get out of here!”
Gu Fei did not even have time to reply.
The two rushed out of the city as they left the Auction House. After walking for a short distance, they heard a flurry of footsteps. Gu Fei looked back and saw a bunch of players heading straight toward the Auction House.
“They can’t all be after me!” Gu Fei expressed his shock.
“It appears they are,” Brother Assist affirmed.
“There’re so many of them!” Gu Fei exclaimed.
“Just turn yourself in,” Brother Assist calmly replied.
“Nah...” Gu Fei declined.
“Perhaps you should cover your face. With many people looking for you, there’s no guarantee that a sharp-eyed player won’t discover you. Those who have accepted this mission will see a conspicuous serial number marking on you,” Brother Assist advised.
“Alright. But I’ll leave the city first. There’re too many pairs of eyes around, which make things difficult,” Gu Fei hastily bolted out of the city. Brother Assist’s speed was not a match for Gu Fei’s, so he could only shout after his fleeing figure, “Be careful!”
Gu Fei waved his hand in acknowledgement without even turning around.
Brother Assist returned to the Auction House alone. Countless players were searching the place thoroughly, with more joining in as time went by. Brother Assist thought he had a good grasp of the situation’s severity, yet he had not expected Gu Fei to attract these many pursuers. Human’s curiosity was indeed a frightening thing.
Brother Assist contacted Young Master Han and his fellow mercenary mates once he had left the Auction House. All were extremely astonished when they heard the news, “WHAT? That guy didn’t know about the PvP rules?”
“That guy is hopeless! Meeting! We’re having an emergency meeting!” Young Master Han first criticized Gu Fei before telling everyone to meet at the usual hangout, Ray’s Bar.
Meanwhile, Gale Force of Traversing Four Seas hurriedly sought their guild leader, Oathless Sword.
“Our chance is here!” The main door to Traversing Four Seas’ guild house almost flew off its hinges when Gale Force came crashing through.
Oathless Sword was currently at the lounge, conversing with a few beauties from their guild. Gale Force’s abrupt interruption made Oathless Sword feel slightly annoyed. He furrowed his brows and said heavily, “Conciseness is a merit. But you must remain calm even when things happen and avoid panicking!”
“The Masked Slayer is on the Wanted Players list!” Gale Force shouted immediately.
“After cutting down No Smile so many times, of course he will be on it,” Oathless Sword said matter-of-factly, remaining composed in front of the babes, “Come. Let’s go take a look.”
Oathless Sword suavely waved goodbye to the ladies and calmly exited the guild house. He gently closed the door behind him as he agitatedly said, “F*CKING HELL! HE’S BEING HUNTED?! Why did he not turn himself in and squat in prison? Won’t his identity be exposed now that everyone is after him?! What’s the point of covering his face, then?!”
Gale Force was speechless.
“Say something!” Oathless Sword’s hurried expression was completely different from how he had acted inside the guild house just now.
“I don’t – I don’t know either! All I heard is that the place with ‘Bounty Mission’ released a new Wanted Players list with a fugitive with 15 PK points. Who else could it be besides that Masked Slayer?”
“Let’s go take a look!” Oathless Sword and Gale Force hurriedly strode off toward the Bounty Assignment Hall.
A large crowd had gathered in front of the Bounty Assignment Hall’s Wanted Players list interface. Oathless Sword’s eyes swept through the crowd and noticed that many core members of the various guilds in Yunduan City were here as well. Oathless Sword easily guessed their intentions; they hoped to befriend this powerful expert and pull the Masked Slayer into their guilds. Although Oathless Sword had such thoughts as well, he figured that mulling over it was pointless since nobody could tell who would receive such privilege with these many competitors.
Oathless Sword turned to check the Wanted Players list. The Masked Slayer was listed high on the board – PK points: 15, serial number 27149.
Many of the people inside the hall did not immediately receive the mission as they were confident that Gu Fei would turn himself in. They closely observed all the players coming and going since this hall was also a place where fugitives could turn themselves in. Their eyes would periodically gleam whenever they saw a Mage and then be followed by a look of disappointment.
“This explains why he did not turn himself in. Doing so is as good as walking straight into the lion’s den,” Oathless Sword mumbled to himself. Quite a few Mages were entering and exiting the place, yet the serial number 27149 remained on the top spot.
In one corner of the hall, July, Luo Luo, and Lie Lie were observing the human traffic as well.
“Ah, that one! That’s definitely him! He’s wearing a beginner robe!” Lie Lie boomed as she pointed to a player for the seventeenth time.
Luo Luo appraised the player and sighed, “Lie Lie! A pro may not necessarily be handsome, so curb your wishful thinking and stop calling my attention to every good-looking Mage here! That last one is only at level 12.”
“Oh....”
“How long have we been here, anyway?” July asked.
“Close to half an hour,” Luo Luo answered.
“Is it possible that he does not intend to turn himself in?” July wondered.
“That can’t be. With a PK value of 15, he’ll have to drift outside the city for thirty hours. Doesn’t he have to go offline? If he goes to a designated log-off point, any player who has taken the ‘Bounty Mission’ might manage to kill him off before he reaches the safe zone,” Luo Luo said.
“How else would you explain why he hasn’t shown up yet?” July swept her gaze across the Wanted Players list.
“Maybe he has predicted that there’ll be plenty of people waiting for him to surrender himself, so he found a place to while his time away instead!” Luo Luo suggested.
“Oh! Guess we’ve got to wait a bit more, then!”
They held onto that sort of mentality as they patiently waited until it was past an hour.
“Ah! It’s – It’s – Oh... It’s just a Priest,” Lie Lie exclaimed as she pointed at the most beautiful individual she had seen by far.
Luo Luo followed Lie Lie’s gaze and her eyes shone.
Luo Luo gently tugged at her friends as she indicated the same person and whispered into their ears, “That’s Young Master Han.”
Young Master Han circled the Bounty Assignment Hall once and left quickly. Luo Luo dragged July and Lie Lie and stealthily followed him.
Young Master Han walked at a slow pace. Once he crossed two streets and got on to an isolated alley, he abruptly turned around. The three ladies quickly hid in a corner when they saw him turn.
“Stop hiding and just come out! Someone’s already watching your every move!” Young Master Han called out.
“Don’t move. He’s bluffing,” Lie Lie said.
“He’s not bluffing...” a clear voice sounded from behind the three ladies.
The ladies were dumbfounded. Lie Lie looked back and immediately felt bewildered, “Did you guys hear someone speak?”
July stood still and looked behind them, sighing into the air, “There’s a Thief on Stealth behind us!”
“Can you all come out now?” Young Master Han called out once more.
The three walked out from behind the corner restlessly. Lie Lie hurled some punches and kicks behind her, yet she struck nothing solid.
“You’re pretty careful! To actually have someone trail you,” Luo Luo complimented.
Young Master Han ignored her praise and coldly stated, “Our deal ended yesterday.”
“That’s true. But a new deal can always be made,” Luo Luo reasoned.
“We’re busy right now to accept any new deal,” Young Master Han bluntly said.
“What could you be busy with?” Luo Luo asked.
Young Master Han chuckled dryly, “Do you have to ask?”
“Since the whole thing started because of us, we feel obliged to offer our assistance,” July said sincerely.
“Miss, our service has been paid at a reasonable rate by you. You don’t owe us anything. Everything happening right now is our group’s business. We don’t need you to worry about us. Please take back your kind offer and just be on your way!” Young Master Han turned and prepared to leave after saying this.
“Young Master Han!” Lie Lie hastily shouted.
Young Master Han stopped mid step.
“We know your name and appearance. Aren’t you afraid that we’ll leak this out?” Lie Lie hollered.
“Lie Lie!” July and Luo Luo did not expect Lie Lie to say such a thing.
“Are you threatening me?” Young Master Han turned around and stared at Lie Lie.
“No. What I meant is since you’re okay with us knowing your identity, then why aren’t you fine with letting us know the other members of your group as well? We’ll surely keep it a secret!” Lie Lie promised.
Young Master Han laughed and said to July, “You should ask your guild leader. I believe she’ll understand my intention.”
July froze on the spot.
“Stop following me. My personality isn’t that great and I’m having a bad day, so I may lose my temper. I’ll give you a friendly advice: Don’t acquire the ‘Bounty Mission’ just to find out his identity. He’s cruel and will not go easy on anyone! He’s a real killer!” Young Master Han was filled with resentment as he grinded his teeth over these last few words, turning to leave once more.
“He is far too arrogant!” Lie Lie said indignantly.
“Miss, it’s not polite to speak ill of someone behind his back,” the unseen person suddenly quipped.
“Why are you still here?!” Lie Lie stamped her feet in anger, “Scram, you voyeur!” She threw kicks and punches in the air once more.
“Let’s go, Lie Lie,” July dragged Lie Lie along.
“So are we taking the mission, Sis July?” Luo Luo asked.
“Of course, we’re taking it,” July said decisively, “But we’re not after his identity; we’ll try to see how we can be of help to him.”

Chapter 100 Buying Land (1)
Lian Fang Zhou and Lian Ze took the big bag of potatoes home where Third Aunt and the others came out to look at it.
Third Aunt said: “I have never heard of beans growing in the soil in all my life! I have to take a good look at such a strange thing!”
“I haven’t seen it either, I want to watch as well!” Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che looked at the potatoes with their eyes wide open.
Opening the mouth of the sack, Lian Fang Qing and Lian Che fought to take one out from inside. It was bigger than an egg, causing them both to let out a ‘wow’ in surprise and smile over the rare thing.
Third Aunt was also taken aback and exclaimed, “This is a potato, it’s really big! Oh, and its covered in mud!”
Lian Fang Zhou smiled, thinking that it was only this small. It must be restricted by the current seeding and planting methods. If it was a modern potato, it wouldn’t be uncommon for it to be as big as an adult’s fist.
“I don’t think it looks like a bean at all!” Lian Che leaned in for a closer look.
“I just don’t know if its delicious or not!” Lian Fang Qing said crisply.
Third Aunt smiled at her and said, “I think so too!”
Lian Fang Zhou smiled and said, “It will finish growing next year so you’ll be able to eat your fill! This is for planting, so you can’t eat it! If someone finds out, you’ll be in trouble!”
Even Fang Qing understood the importance of seeds and nodded.
“Just don’t know whether it’s a good crop or not!” Third Aunt sighed.
Lian Fang Zhou smiled: “There is nothing good or bad about this, ok! Let’s just plant it like soybeans!”
The government was truly too unreliable! Just sending the seeds down, there was no superficial guidance such as when to plant the seeds, what kind of land was suitable, how to water them, or when to harvest.
“That’s what I was thinking! No matter what, the name has a word for ‘bean’ so it should be ok to plant it like soybeans!” Third Aunt smiled, “Fang Zhou is still the smartest!”
Everyone was talking and laughing. Generally, Ah Jian always sat quietly on the side during such occasions and didn’t say much. Lian Ze mostly laughed and couldn’t speak.
After talking for a while, Lian Fang Zhou carefully tied the sack and clapped her hands, smiling: “Okay, I’ve seen it before so let’s wash and sleep! These seeds must be put in the attic tomorrow! Third Aunt, I will leaving early tomorrow morning. Since I am going to the city with Ah Jian and Ah Ze, I will likely be very busy these few days and you will be the only one to take care of things at home!
Third Aunt agreed with a smile and everyone finished getting ready to sleep.
After breakfast the next day, Lian Fang Zhou, Lian Ze, and Ah Jian went out to the county seat.
Ah Jian said: “If money is not tight, let’s buy a donkey or a donkey cart. I’m afraid there will be more later and just walking will not only be more tiring but also delay things!”
Lian Fang Zhou thought about his reasoning. Not only would they need to buy donkeys, but they would also need to buy cattle. There were also many farming tools that needed to be replaced. Everything needed to be planned for carefully!
 However, the most important thing was to buy the land first! Buy the land and then purchase the other things according to the number of fields.
“I agree! When we satisfied with the land, we will visit the livestock market and learn more about the prices. We need to buy them at the right price and livestock is cheaper in the winter than at the beginning of spring! For now, let’s work hard on our own, then we can take care of winter! Lian Fang Zhou laughed.
Lian Ze laughed with her, feeling very happy. “Sister, do we have to buy donkeys and donkey carts? I can’t even image it! Don’t worry, I will take good care of them in the future!”
“Oh, won’t this delay your practice?” Lian Fang Zhou raised her eyebrows and joked, causing the three of them to laugh.
Lian Ze got up before dawn today to practice cultivation, saying that it would be the same in the future. He really was studying hard to learn martial arts and protect his family.
“Sister!” Lian Ze scratched his head, looking very embarrassed, and said solemnly: “Never! I have the help the family with work too, everyone is still so young, I can’t tire my sister!”
“Sister really has a good brother!” Lian Fang Zhou smiled.
The three of them entered the city and first went to the bank to exchange one thousands tael bank notes into seven ‘hundred taels’. The remaining three ‘hundred taels’ were split into ‘fifty taels’ and ‘twelve taels’. She also kept twelve ounces of broken silver in her pocket for petty use.
Because Dafang Village was not too far away from the county seat, villagers needed to go directly to the city if they wanted to buy land. Villages that were more remote would usually go to the nearest town for such things.
The three of them inquired about where to find the home of Liu Jia, the land steward who bought and sold land around the county seat, and bought two boxes of dim sum from a dim sum shop.
Liu Jia happened to be at home and when the three strangers appeared, he knew that it must be a business matter. He smiled politely and greeted: “How many surnames? Are you here to buy land? Haha, come and sit!”
When Liu Jia spoke, he directed his words to Ah Jian as he was the only adult among the three of them. He took it for granted that Ah Jian was in charge.
Ah Jian nodded and said, “We want to look at the mountains. I wonder if there is anything suitable?”
Lian Fang Zhou added: “We are from Dafang Village. If you can, see if you can sell something close to Dafang or in a nearby village!”
Liu Jia had several paddy fields for sale and hearing them ask about worthless dry land, the enthusiasm in his heart suddenly cooled. However, mosquito legs are also meat, let alone his job, so the smile on his face remained and he asked, “I will take a look at the booklet. I wonder how much you want to buy?”
While he spoke, he went into the inner room and retrieved the special recording booklet.
Lian Fang Zhou smiled and said, “About two thousand acres!”
“How much?” Liu Jia asked as he came out of the back room, his eyes wide open.
“Two thousand acres, can you see if you have something ready on hand? If you don’t have anything, could you think of a way to find some?” Lian Fang Zhou smiled, her words falling into Liu Jia’s ears clearly.
Liu Jia was stunned and looked to Ah Jian for approval.
“For the details, just tell Miss Lian!” Ah Jian smiled. He didn’t quite understand such things as farming and land buying.
“This…” Liu Jia moved his lips, slapped his head, and sat down with a smile: “I’ve been doing land stewardship for a few years of my life and I’ve never meet anyone like you! You want so much land but I’m afraid I don’t know if there is any!”
Liu Jia looked closely at the booklet and soon his eyes lit up. He smiled and said, “Here is a more suitable one!”
Here, a rich man in Dafang village dislikes these dry lands and feels that they are not very productive and are too troublesome. It is about to be sold and the total is more than 160 mu (960 acres). Not far away, there is another piece of land outside of Yangjia Village. It is about 380 acres. His son is in urgent need of a large sum of money for his business so the family is selling a lot of their fields. Between there is more than two hundred and eighty acres belonging to four families. If you want to connect your land into one piece, you will need to talk to them about buying or exchanging. Of course, I’m afraid you will suffer a little loss in price.
The remaining large piece is more than 600 acres of unowned wasteland. If you want to buy it, you will need to pay a land reclamation fee to the village first and then pay a sum of land sale money to the government at the official price. You’ll spend more money but there is some benefit. There is no tax payment for three years. Together, the total is more than 1,500 acres.

Chapter 100: New Car
"Father, can you guess the origin of this organization?" David was still very uneasy about the mysterious organization. He asked Hans.
"David, do you know the origin of the holy water of immortality?" Instead of answering directly, Hans asked.
He was playing with the test tube containing the "holy water of immortality", but there was a cold light in his eyes.
"Father, do you know?" David was so excited that he asked in a hurry.
The organization attaches so much importance to the "holy water of immortality", which must be a special resource mastered by the organization. Hans knows the origin of the "holy water of immortality", so the origin of the organization can be guessed.
"The holy water of immortality" is not a product of the Federation, but a specialty of the great world of God. As for how to produce it, I don't know. " Hans explained.
"If this organization can get the" holy water of immortality ", will it have something to do with God's great world David asked again.
"Although the" immortal holy water "is a specialty of God's big world, some powerful people in the warstar Federation also have friendship with the strong ones of God's big world, and they will also exchange some" immortal holy water ". Therefore, it is far fetched to conclude that the organization has something to do with God's great world alone." Said Hans, shaking his head.
However, David's hair was creepy, because what he got was not the five bottles of "immortal holy water", but a whole box of 450 bottles of it.
According to the meaning of Hans, listening to it in turn is a large number of "immortal holy water", which is bound to have something to do with God's belonging to the big world.
He stopped immediately and wanted to say more about the organization and the "holy water of youth". Hans could not be implicated in this matter.
If the judgment is correct, he is likely to be the enemy of some organization of God's great world, or at least an organization supported by God's great world.
This kind of force, not to mention a student like him, can't face it safely even if it is many times stronger.
The reason why David was able to survive before was that the organization only regarded him as a small role and did not pay attention to him.
Once you know that he is the one who killed Jeremy's trainer and robbed the "holy water of youth", the pursuit will not stop.
"Father, can five bottles of" immortal holy water "cure you David shifted the subject and asked the questions he had asked at the beginning.
"Of course, it can repair my body, but it's too wasteful. A bottle of" immortal holy water "can be sold at a high price anywhere Hans pushed back the five bottles of "holy water of youth" in front of him, and continued: "David, you need more resources in the future. There are not many credit points that can be provided for you by the st hotel. These five bottles of" not old holy water "can exchange a lot of resources for you."
"Father, you don't have to refuse. This is a piece of my heart. If you are in good health, you will not be remembered by the organization as a national scholar!" David laughed and pushed back the "holy water of youth" and said.
Hans pauses for a moment when he hears this, and then takes two of the five bottles of the holy water of immortality.
"Two bottles are enough." although the "holy water of youth" is praised as prolonging life in the Federation, its therapeutic effect is far beyond the medical level of the federal government. " Hans explained.
His body was injured in the war, and his injuries were very complicated. He used the Jiashi sniper gun beyond his physical endurance, was affected by Zerg toxin, and had overdrawn his life.
Even if the federal government has the medical level of gene repair, it can't repair his body. Maybe it is possible, but it can't be allowed by the federal government just to treat one person at a huge cost.
But God belongs to the big world, where there are many mysterious methods that cannot be explained by science. Among them, the "immortal holy water" is one of them.
"Father, the remaining three bottles of" not old holy water "you also keep for standby David insisted.
Hans looked at David for a moment. He seemed to feel something, and then he took a long breath.
"I'll take it all. You must pay attention to your safety. Let me know if you have any trouble, or tell Galen!" Hans said in a deep voice, and then he went on: "as for the title of" statesman ", I will just will, you are the direct successor of" Guoshi "
David wanted to refuse, but after thinking about it, he didn't say anything.
Although the title of "national scholar" is of great benefit to the promotion of his status and his future.
However, he is confident that he can achieve more with his own hands, and has no idea about the title of "national scholar".
But without this justice, not only will he be in danger because of the title of "national scholar", but even little Edie will be implicated by the title.
He will bear all the pressure. If the organization wants to get the title of "national scholar", he must be killed first, and then he will be considered to deal with the Hans family.
When Hans left, David didn't ask Hans to keep the secret about the "holy water of immortality" because he didn't need to say anything about it. Just seeing Hans pack five bottles of "holy water of immortality" in multi-layer packaging and using other outer packaging to camouflage, we can know that Hans is very aware of the need for confidentiality.
After sending Hans away, David didn't let the shadow boy transmit energy to him. His body was not fully recovered at this time. He didn't want to waste any money.
Because of this, he didn't even dare to reach out to explore the situation of his shadow body, for fear that he would be forced to focus on his soul energy once he touched.
"David, how did you leave the hospital?" Before he sat down for a while, he received a message from Jim.
"My little injury was repaired in a short time in the hospital!" David smiles back to Jim through the identity bracelet.
"Stop talking. Where are you? I'll pick you up. I'll get together anyway!" Jim said directly.
David shook his head and sent his position.
But five minutes later, David saw the military floating vehicle with the military logo flying over his yard and descending into the courtyard.
"Jim, why did you come in a military car?" David looked at the military sign in surprise.
We should know that although Jim had been driving military floating vehicles before, they did not carry military marks. That can only be regarded as civilian military vehicles, but today it is different. This military floating vehicle has military logo, which can be said to be a vehicle with military privileges.
Just like now, Jim flies in a low altitude way, and the general uses a floating car to drive it. Before, he dared not do so.
Skynet doesn't ask if you are the second generation of the army in perland. As long as you don't have permission, you will be locked directly.
"Hey, how's this guy?" Jim jumped out of the military floating car and patted it with pride.
"You're not afraid to be killed by Lieutenant Eaton!" David joked.
"The type-2 land tiger armored vehicle is equipped with an unmanned reconnaissance and scanning UAV, a rapid fire gun, and two heavy-duty rapid fire machine guns on the left and right, powered by krypton crystal. It is the best military vehicle for the city defense brigade!" Jim, however, introduced himself.
"Jim, you won't give Lieutenant Eaton any trouble by driving this out?" David was startled and asked quickly.
He didn't expect such a floating vehicle to be loaded with so many weapons. It was said to be a floating vehicle, but it was not much different from a small war fortress.
"My father asked me to send it. My father said that before the military achievements are approved, he can't advance your authority for you, but he can allocate this military vehicle to you to protect your safety, which is also the first reward of the military!" Jim smiles, sends a transfer of authority document to David's identity bracelet and says.
"Jim, thank Lieutenant Eaton for me. I love this car!" David's heart is very happy, as a man who does not love military vehicles, especially this kind of military vehicles loaded with a variety of weapons.
"Get in the car, let's go out and try the car!" Jim opened the co pilot's door, jumped in and yelled.
David was also interested. He opened the driver's door and jumped in.
Sitting in the driver's seat, I was very excited to see many more buttons and military style panels than ordinary floating cars.
However, he took out the operation manual and read it first. If he didn't understand the function of various buttons and turn on the weapon system in the city, it would be really troublesome.

Chapter 330: Consultation
Since coming to New York, it is naturally impossible for Adrian to go back immediately, anyway, the film is not going well, and there is only one shot, so I should take a holiday and adjust my mood. Stone had to go back, she still had her own work, so he sent her back in another small private plane, and he got into Amber Heard.
Although many of the women around me are in New York at the moment, the crew of “Princess in Prada” has not left, the location of “Gossip Girl” is in New York, Scarlett and Ji Li’s competition, Litton and Black’s competition , Are very good games, but early adopters will never get tired, not to mention Aimeibo is very willing to communicate with him in depth. “,
In fairness, Aimei Bai is not a particularly casual woman, but she does let go. When Adrian first teased her, she directly stated that she was bisexual. Of course, for Adrian, this is not a problem, not to mention that he can… So this time in New York, Aimeibo was completely settled.
Then, even with the help of Teresa, with Ai Meibo help blowing in her ear, Adrian spent less time. That’s right, she feels very much about her and has been trying to tease Teresa, but it’s a pity not knowing whether she didn’t realize it or pretended not to see it, and never expressed her attitude, so Aimeibo will make this decision and work on Adrian After taking Teresa back to the hotel, I waited in advance. “Look”
This is indeed cheaper Adrian, but for Ai Meibo, it is worth it.
As for Teresa’s struggle, it’s not worth it. She would like to open it. Since she wants to be the second Blanchett or Naomi, she will want to open it, not to mention Adrian’s. enlighten.
However, the Adrian is refreshing, and the side effects that accompanied him are a bit overwhelming. First, Leighton and Black’s counterattack in the RV, both of them are dressed in his favorite uniform at present. The two people who usually competed suddenly were extremely skillful and tacit, which surprised him. Then came Scarlett and Ji Li. They said they wanted to continue the previous competition. The two pairs of plump temptations combined with many new tricks were dazzling.
Following Alexander and Miranda, the two women took full advantage of their long legs and pinched his waist. In the end, even Julia put down her restraint and tried it with Annie to see who had a stronger mouth.
Although these happened within two days. It is only a minor challenge for Adrian, but from the actions of the women, he still knows what will happen if he stays again. Although Adrian doesn’t mind trying, after all, except for the original beach party and the previous “Desperate Housewives” party, even occasional scuffles are small-scale, and they have not brought together several women who do not deal with each other as they did.
However, if the women are annoyed and let them fight with their enemies, it is difficult to say what will happen, even if Annie may be more obedient than a pet. So he quickly boarded the plane and returned to the west coast.
Actually, Adrian also knows their thoughts, it just means that they don’t want more women to share a slice of soup, not only in bed, but also in life. The chain of interests he created in one hand basically included most women.
For example, the respective fashion brands of Monica and Alexandria, such as the film and television production companies of Sarah and Julia, such as Lin Zhiling and Gao Yuanyuan, they are monopolizing Asian high-end female roles in Hollywood and so on. There may be a small number of women who are not among them, but there is enough space. Therefore, one more woman may get more. For them now, this is definitely not want to see.
Okay, Adrian did not intend to have a collection. Although Stone, Amber, and Teresa all have their own tastes, in his opinion, it is enough to play a bit of fresh food from time to time. There is no need to put it on the shelf. . The only thing that has kept him in the past two years is Allen Peggy, a Canadian girl who is not pretty but has a lot of taste. This is surprising, but it is an absolute fact.
Because of this, he wanted to give Juno to Christine to hone his acting skills, but considering that the “Evil in the American Countryside” that originally belonged to Allen had been handed over to Christine, so In the end, it was left to Allen’s prophetic advantage, plus the group’s advantage in the Internet, it was no problem finding the blogger Diapolo Cotti and publishing her brochure and then adapting it into a movie.
Of course, women don’t care about this, they just see him licking the flowers again and again, in order to stifle those potential possibilities, they don’t mind joining together. For Adrian, if there are only one, two, three, or four women, this is fine, but if there are more joints, he will have to make concessions.
Okay, not to mention this, after returning to Los Angeles, almost a week later, and finally, four months ago, the first billionaire played the billionaire superhero movie “Iron Man” , Officially sealed the mirror.
The scene on that day was full of joy. After Fei Ru announced the completion, many people screamed and ran their hats and coats towards the ceiling, as if they finally got rid of it.
“Is my performance so bad?” Adrian couldn’t help asking. Then, for a few seconds now, everyone looked at it, and then gave a consistent answer in unison: “Yes! “
It’s quite neat and uniform, like rehearsing countless times. From the director to the assistant director to the assistant and other actors, none of them ran. If anyone without knowledge sees this scene, they will definitely think that Adrian will do it. What is the indignation of man and god. But unfortunately, he had expected this to happen, so the counterattack was also quite sharp. Immediately shot Fear’s shoulder: “Well, we will see you in the second part.”
Fei Ru froze for a moment, then rolled his eyes, but he had two contracts at first, and then the other people who reacted also lamented, and one after another was quite interesting.
Okay, the procrastinating movie has finally ended, and the pace of life has once again returned to the leisurely look at the beginning of the year. Although Adrian has been very leisurely this year, it is also good to have more time to accompany women and daughters. By the way, you can also play games.
“Maybe I should really expel the guy who designed this profession. A buff has only five minutes and a holy seal has only 30 seconds. If you use the trial, you have to open another one to have additional attacks. What is this profession? Or is it just a pastime?” Adrian looked at the game characters in the computer screen with his hands on his head with some depression, although he had already expected these and had already played to level 45. But he couldn’t help but want to sigh.
Fortunately, Dava ran over and grabbed her little raccoon puppet, stood on tiptoe and looked hard: “What is Dad doing?”
“Hey, my dear, are you dressed up? Let dad look.” Adrian was about to hug the little guy.
Black hair is very long, two little braids hang down from the shoulders, wearing a beige dress, cheek bulging, cute and cute.
“Am I very beautiful, Dad?” Deva waved her puppet in triumph.
“Of course. Very beautiful, just like a little angel, my mother would pick clothes.” Adrian said by pinching her fleshy face, “especially this little hairpin, and you are very”
Deva rolled her eyes and suddenly leaned into her father’s ear and said: “Don’t tell mom, Juliet helped me choose the hairpin and shoes.”
Then she chuckled again, seeming very proud, very cute.
“Really?” Adrian raised an eyebrow. “So Juliet is very picky? It seems that you can be her model in the future.”
“Okay, okay, I will let Juliet specifically choose clothes in the future.” Deva shouted loudly. If Juliet saw and heard, she would have to quarrel with her.
With age. Dava and Juliet were noisy and noisy. After all, they were going to school soon, but the noise between the two had never been too intense, and they always deepened each other’s feelings. Until now. The two little guys must sleep together wherever they go. Sometimes I really want to have such a pair of twins who are not twins.
Adrian immediately gathered in the past to want to kiss the little guy, but Deva hided back and frowned: “No. Dad’s beard is so stiff.”
“Oh?” Adrian raised an eyebrow, and when she was about to pull her into her arms, she rubbed her stubble on the flesh’s cheek and yelled at the little guy.
“I hate to die, Dad is a bad guy! Big bad guy!” After finally struggling to jump to the ground, Dava made a big grimace, and then ran out quickly.
“What’s the matter? Playing tricks on Dava again?” Monica came out from the middle at the moment, wearing a black translucent dress with a wide brim hat on her head, very classic.
“Of course not.” Although Adrian said so, he touched his chin proudly. Since leaving a beard for “Iron Man”, stubbornly piercing his daughter’s face became a required course, even Lily. Daring guys can’t avoid this trick.
I can see that Monica gave him a blank look, but didn’t say much, just raised her hands: “How do I look?”
“It’s pretty.” Adrian smiled slightly, walked around her, and hugged her belly from behind. “It’s still so charming.”
Although Monica smiled, she sighed in the corner of her eyes: “Unconsciously, the crow’s feet are already so deep.”
“So what?” Adrian grabbed her hand and pulled her over. “Everyone will be old, this is a natural phenomenon, there is no need to avoid it. And, for you, there are more and more Charm, like the red wine that has been stored for many years, exudes a faint but fascinating taste, which was not felt at first, but if you drink more, the mellow aftertaste can make you drunk.”
Monica didn’t answer, just looked at him, Adrian took her face and kissed gently at the corner of her eyes: “You are mine, Monica, no matter you are old or sick, you It’s all mine.”
He said this more than once, but it was never as meaningful as it is now, so Monica fell into her arms and hugged him tightly, holding nothing quietly until she knocked on the door The sound rang.
“If you don’t leave, you’ll be late,” Sophie appeared at the door, a very tasteful women’s suit and trousers, and then raised her eyebrows when she realized something, “Are you doing what?”
“Nothing, just feeling a little bit,” Adrian with one arm around Monica’s waist, smiled and stretched the other hand around Sophie’s waist, and then took her into her arms, “I am so lucky to have you.”
“Yeah, you are so lucky.” Sophie rolled her eyes and bit the word “you” very hard.
Adrian didn’t seem to hear it, and she smiled and stretched her hand over the crow’s feet of her eyes: “Of course, I can watch a little increase here. I will also watch the increase and help massage. How can I not be lucky.
Sophie froze for a while, her still beautiful eyes showed surprise and complicated eyes. After so many years together, how could she not hear what he said. Moving her head to the other side, Monica leaned on Adrian with a smile. As a person who has lived together for several years and has faced countless times in bed alone, Sophie basically understood.
“Hum!” Although he hummed softly, his eyes became very soft when he watched Adrian. The atmosphere of nostalgic sentiment immediately flows between the three, warm and very comfortable.
“Okay, let’s go, otherwise the following two little guys will run up.” Adrian said after a while, so he walked up the stairs with arms around Sophie and Monica.
But in two steps, he reached out and squeezed their still buttocks hard, and the previous atmosphere suddenly disappeared. Although Sophie and Monica were annoyed, they could only give him a glance. Adrian couldn’t help laughing.
Going downstairs, grabbing Dava and Juliet running around, a group of people went out and got on the car to the Beverly Hills, Adrian mansion. Today is the monthly gathering of mothers.
Frankly speaking, as the number of children increases, this party gradually becomes a little tasteless. Adrian initially arranged this to take into account that the children’s mothers should be relatively peaceful when they get together. Can communicate better with each other. However, as the number of children increases, the mother team also increases. Zeta Jones, Nicole and Naomi were added last year and this year. Adrian has already hinted at Rachel and she chose the default. In the future, Alexander, Miranda, Britney, Christina and so on, I am afraid that none of them can run away, one can imagine.
Then, people will always hold a group, and those who do not deal with them will never deal with them. For example, Zeta Jones has always been unable to talk to Cate. In fact, the three Cate do not deal with it very much, but Blanchett is more restrained. And Nicole and Gwyneth always have a little friction with each other, although they have fought fiercely at the beach party, so Adrian rarely pulls all women down on the same occasion.
It was okay before, but after Sandy and Alice were born, every time their mothers gathered, Adrian would be very busy and balance their relationship, so as to avoid any trouble. Of course, he can also cancel the big party and divide it into several small parties to let the mothers who have a good relationship with each other chat and communicate together, but he hardly ever thought about it.
“I don’t want Lily to feel alienated from her sisters in the future,” Adrian said seriously after Cate asked this question implicitly, “We are already a big family anyway, I hope the children Being able to get along peacefully, even because of the increase of age, there must be a lot of friction between each other, and may even be against the eyes, but at least it will not be naturally contradictory because of the different mothers.”
“…It’s not your fault.” Cate said this after a long silence, ironically but at the same time helpless, who let the **** “kidnap” himself.
Of course, Adrian does not deny that it is his own fault, so it’s no big deal to be so painful and happy once a month, anyway, he has a lot of time now.
In addition to allowing him to arrange these better, the extra time can also be used to plan some movies in more detail, such as Cate’s next work to go to Oscar. At present, in her several nominations, Adrian has just pushed one behind, and has accumulated a lot of qualifications, and her acting skills have been hone step by step. So this time he specially selected a Cate “Once” political movie. I plan to see what she can do without intervening.
In addition, the new line is busy with “Twilight”, has confirmed that she will star in the heroine Jessica? Stoja Dinovic, currently because of his bad taste has been officially renamed For Stoya? Dole. Of course, he has already tasted it in bed, and the renamed Stoya is quite obedient. She knows who gave it to herself, so she will do whatever the Adrian asks.
Adrian is very satisfied with her obedient and supple appearance, and then look at the list of actors in “Twilight” that was selected by her own intervention~IndoMTL.com~ In addition to the stars who played two heroines Outside of Justin and Kim Tae-hee, Ashley Greene and Brooklyn Decker respectively played a pair of sisters of the Karen family, the heroine’s mother was Amanda Pete, and Mrs. Karen’s Janny Ray Jones.
It’s not bad. If Stoyar helps, like Aimeibo, it shouldn’t be difficult to get them one by one. Oh, speaking of this, Adrian intends to play one of the villainous female vampires in her second part, and the other…still Dakota Fanning.
According to Adrian‘s ideas, Dakota has no room to rise in child stars, and soon the embarrassment period that each child star needs to face will come. So take it easy and play some of these business roles to spend the best of this period, but she seems to have some ideas of her own.
“This is…” Adrian looked at the script in his hand and then looked at Dakota who was slightly nervous in front of him.
“I just want to hear your opinion.” She said in a respectful tone.
“Okay.” Adrian opened the cover, and the name of the script appeared clearly in front of him: “Hound”

Chapter 150 - Break 4 limbs
heard Xiao Ma’s words, Ling Xiao was not angry, his eyes narrowed slightly.
A sharp edge flashed out of his eyes and landed on the horse governing body. The horse governing body shuddered, and felt like he was being stared at by an ancient beast, and his body was a little stiff.
But immediately, a look of anger and anger appeared in his heart.
How could I be scared by a boy with triple spirits? This kid is so abominable!
“How do you know that Master Jiaomu won’t come out to meet me? I advise you to report it obediently, otherwise what will happen next, but I can’t control it!” Ling Xiao said lightly.
A fierce light flashed in Ma Guanshi’s eyes and sneered: “Boy, you are really arrogant! Now I have changed my mind. If you kneel in front of me and kowtow for mercy, I can interrupt your limbs and save your life , Otherwise, don’t blame me!”
“Knocking for mercy and interrupting your limbs? This is a good idea. If you go to talk and let Jiaomu come to see me, I can spare you too!”
Ling Xiao nodded faintly, his expression was extremely calm, facing the powerful coercion of the horse manager, it seemed to be unconscious.
Everyone laughed silently. Isn’t this kid scared? How dare he threaten the horse manager?
Everyone knows the ruthlessness of horse stewardship. Someone had trouble in the Lingyao Pavilion before. They were all interrupted by the horse stewardship.
Even if those powerful high-ranking officials are noble, they are very polite in the face of horse management, just because the sister of horse management is the concubine of the deputy head of the Lingyao Pavilion.
People in Chunyang do not pay attention to common affairs on weekdays, so most of the things in the Lingyao Pavilion are managed by the deputy patriarch Sun Qiyuan.
“Boy, you are dead!” Ma Guanshi’s complexion instantly dimmed, and a cold killer appeared in his eyes. He was born with vigorous air, and he slapped a hand towards Lingxiao.
His palm lingered with a faint black light, as hard as stone, as if it could smash everything.
Iron Palm! Profound martial arts, struck with a palm, broken gold crack stone, if the warrior was hit by the iron sand palm, the internal organs will be broken by the strong palm power instantly, and the gods can’t be saved.
Horse manager This is the killing of Ling Xiao, so the best shot is the iron sand palm.
The iron sand palm came out of the air, containing a trace of grief, and there was a humming sound, and instantly arrived in front of Ling Xiao.
In the eyes of everyone, Ling Xiao seemed like a fool, standing there dumbly, motionless.
Some people have even begun to stand up, so that a young boy will be killed by the horse manager in the next moment.
Boom!
But at the next moment, the imaginary scene of Ling Xiao’s head being shattered by the iron palm did not appear, and Ling Xiao’s hand did not know when he grabbed the horse steward’s arm.
Tie Sha palm stayed in Ling Xiao’s eyebrows, but it was difficult to advance by one point.
“what?!” Ma Guan’s face changed. He felt that his arm was caught by an infinitely powerful beast, and it was hard to struggle.
Click! A clear sound came, and Ma Guanshi’s arm was instantly crushed by Ling Xiao.
Ling Xiao’s expression was indifferent, and Ma Guanshi felt a sudden pain, his face twisted and screamed instantly.
"Ah ah ah ... My hand! 'Little bastard, I want to kill ...' I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you!"
The horse was in a state of madness, with a terrible face, and the other hand shot down towards Ling Xiao. The powerful innate qi burst like a Daoli sword, cracking the bluestone floor in the hall.
Click! Ling Xiao’s complexion was still very calm. He cut his palm like a knife and directly chopped it on the other arm of the horse steward, and suddenly there was a crisp sound. The other arm of the horse steward was also pulled down.
Boom! Ling Xiao’s legs fluttered like wind, kicking the knee of Ma Guanshi into a crush, Ma Guanshi knelt on the ground with a thump, and howled.
The screams of horse stewards resembled killing pigs, resounding throughout the elixir.
“Dare to hunt wild in the elixir pavilion to find death!” Suddenly a few powerful and powerful breaths rushed by, and the eyes were indifferent, exuding a powerful breath, and surrounded Ling Xiao.
These people are all powerful in the Grand Master Realm, and each one has an unpredictable breath. The powerful Qi machine locked Ling Xiao as if he would launch a thunder blow at the next moment.
“Kill me! Kill this little beast!” The horse manager was almost mad, and his limbs were interrupted by Ling Xiao. He kneeled on the ground in humiliation, coughing blood in his mouth, and his face was very twisted.
“I advise you not to move, otherwise your ending might not be much better than him!” Ling Xiao said lightly, even if he was besieged by several great masters and strong men, his expression was still very calm.
The few guru who originally wanted to do something, hesitated when he heard Ling Xiao’s words, and stopped there for a while.
“Jiaomu, I’m here, you don’t get out!” Ling Xiao’s eyes flashed a sharp edge, suffocating his breath~www.mtlnovel.com~ A powerful thunder sound erupted from his mouth, which instantly rang through the elixir pavilion.
Everyone looked stunned, and then looked at Ling Xiao like a fool.
Is this teenager really making trouble? He wounded the horse manager, but he didn’t run away, so it was necessary to disturb Master Jiaomu, wouldn’t he be afraid of death?
And Ma Guanshi’s eyes showed a hint of resentment, but he did not stop Ling Xiao.
When Master Jiaomu comes out, he must let this kid die without a burial place!
Elixir Pavilion, in a secret room. Master Jiao Mu sat in front of a red Dan Ding, but he was gray-faced, his beard was burnt, and there were several holes in his white robe.
Dan Ding in front of him, smoking black smoke, came out a mushy smell!
“Failed again!” Jiao Mu smiled bitterly and said, “Old guy, this sword-hearted dannai is an ancient remedy. The remedy you gave me is still missing two elixir. Although I found another elixir to replace it, it always seemed like What is missing! I have no good way!”
Opposite Jiao Mu, sat a middle-aged man with a vicissitudes face, long hair fluttering, looking unrestrained, elegant and elegant, and at a glance he knew that he was also a beautiful man when he was young. He was carrying an ancient sword behind him, his eyes were clear, and there was a hint of sharp sword mangoes spreading out.
Hearing Master Jiaomu’s words, the middle-aged man’s eyes were dark, and he smiled bitterly: “We have failed hundreds of times in the past few days. It seems that Jianxin Pill and I really have no chance! Let’s go, old Friends, this can’t blame you, it seems that God wants to be the way to heaven!”
Finally, the middle-aged man grabbed a wine gourd around his waist, poured a sip of wine, and concealed the depression in his heart.

Chapter 60 Master
On the first floor of Wan Xiang Tower, Teng Qingshan stands with a knife in his arms, not looking at the guards at all.
Boom, boom...
One of the guards quickly went upstairs to inform the Landlord of Wan Xiang Tower. Wan Xiang Tower has three floors. There are many counters on the first and second floors. Only the third floor prohibits outsiders from entering. This is the first room next to the handrail of the Wan Xiang Tower stairs, where Landlord usually stays.
"Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle!" The young guard rushed in.
"Screaming, what it looks like." Inside the house, there was a cultured middle-aged man in a white robe, splashing ink and painting.
"Martial Uncle, a master came downstairs. It seems that he is a very cruel master." The guard said hurriedly.
"Master?" The cultured middle-aged man frowned slightly, put down his paintbrush, and looked at the guard, "tell me more in detail."
The guard said carefully: "Just now, this swordsman was unwilling to unload the weapon and directly sent the two Junior Martial Sisters at the door to Zhenfei. And to our martial brothers, we are disdain as beneath contempt. We dare not call the shots without authorization. And he also said, Martial Uncle has something to do with you. So..."
"Don't mess around." The cultured middle-aged man said hurriedly, "You have been practicing Inner Strength for more than ten years, and you have little experience. It's not bad for ordinary people. It's still far from dealing with those tough masters. You go and ask him to come up. Your senior brother and your second senior brother are also coming up together."
"Yes, Martial Uncle." The guard immediately retreated.
The cultured middle-aged people are very puzzled: “I don’t know where the characters came from, but I’d better take a look first.” Wanxiang Sect does not have the ambition to dominate the world, but their'Wan Xiang Tower' has spread throughout the entire Nine Prefectures. City, according to the size of the city, the scale of the shop, the number of masters varies.
Like Wan Xiang Tower, only this Landlord is the core disciple of Wanxiang Sect, the pinnacle master of Postliminary Realm.
More than half of the manpower of Wanxiang Sect's entire martial art is scattered among the Wan Xiang Towers in Land of Nine Prefectures. Also because Wanxiang Sect is too rich, it's easy to recruit people.
"Boom, boom..." The sound of footsteps sounded.
A seemingly young swordsman walked in with two guards. The swordsman swept his eyes and locked the cultured middle-aged man sitting at the desk.
Observing the steps, eyes, and temperament of the people coming, this landlord who knows many people instantly has his own judgment: "This is a decisive master, with a strong aura. This sword technique is estimated to be equally strong, and it should be a very strong man. Master.” This Landlord knows very well that different experiences will make people have different temperaments.
For example, rich people are often complimented by people, and they have different attitudes when talking about laughter.
And those who have no strength, dare to be like Teng Qingshan, playing awe-inspiring in Wan Xiang Tower? I'm afraid I'm surrounded by a group of Inner Strength masters, I guess it's drumming from the bottom of my heart.
And when a master does this, it's not a prestige, but a master demeanor!
Those who are not capable dare not to remove their weapons and are still arrogant, I am afraid they will be interrupted and thrown out. While the masters do not unload their weapons, Wan Xiang Tower still has to warmly entertain them.
The same thing, different people do, the result is completely different.
"Wanxiang Sect Huo Yan!" the cultured middle-aged man said with his hands.
"Qin Lang!" Teng Qingshan said, his brother was called ‘Qin Hong’ in previous life, and his killer codename was ‘wolf’ in Underground World. Teng Qingshan also made up this pseudonym-Qin Lang.
This Wan Xiang Tower Landlord Huo Yan quickly searched in his mind, but did not find a person like Qin Lang. However, there are countless powerful people in Land of Nine Prefectures. Huo Yan did not dare to neglect, and said with a smile: "Yi City Little Place, it’s rare to meet a master, Qin Lang brother, please sit down."
Teng Qingshan just showed a slight smile, and Da Ma directly sat down with a golden sword.
"In Yi City, it is indeed difficult to meet Inner Strength masters. But...Wanxiang Sect is worthy of being a martial artist. Many valuables are placed there. Let these disciples venturing from one's thatched hut for the first time to guard. I admire this boldness." Teng Qingshan also said with a smile on his face, simply.
The expressions of the two guards changed slightly, but they did not dare to speak.
Huo Yan chuckled: "These disciples are just for them to experience. In this world, the masters generally give us Wanxiang Sect a little bit thin."
At this time, the maid also served tea.
"I don't know, Brother Qin Lang, what's going on at my Wan Xiang Tower?" Huo Yan said.
Teng Qingshan directly took out Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel from his arms, put it on the low coffee table with a bang, and said with a light smile: "I'm going around the world, honing my swordsmanship. Not long ago, I happened to get this piece of Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel! So, I want to make a deal with you Wan Xiang Tower!"
"Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel? Purple Light Coldsteel?" Huo Yan trembled in his heart, even carefully discerning it, and deliberately covered it with his hand, looking at the halo.
"Sure enough, it really is Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, and the weight is right!" Huo Yan felt the heavy weight in his hand, and then slammed with Inner Strength. This Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel was not damaged at all. This Huo Yan was completely certain that this stone was indeed Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel.
This Huo Yan glanced at Teng Qingshan and couldn't help but think in his heart: "This Qin Lang, Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, this class of treasures are just taken out so casually. It is really bold!
Most people have such treasures, it is too late to hide them.
Huo Yan has seen that some people go to Wan Xiang Tower to sell their treasures. They will do a lot of scheming and worry about being robbed of treasures. But the real master doesn't care, because the master is confident!
If you dare to reach out and grab it, I can cut off your hand and get the baby back!
"Moreover, treasures such as Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel are only born in the extremely cold regions. In the North Sea, those who can get Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel are usually masters. This Qin Lang is said to be obtained at a risk. The place to raise Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel is, of course, a dangerous place. It seems that this young swordsman is very strong." Huo Yan is very clear that one cannot judge a person's strength from his appearance.
Because Inner Strength masters are not very old, a young man who seems to be 20 years old is probably in his 30s or 40s.
For example, Huo Yan, who appears to be forty years old, is actually more than 60 years old.
"Brother Qin Lang, this is indeed Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, I don't know, what price do you want?" Huo Yan said. As soon as the words came out, the two guards standing aside looked at each other, obviously a little hot.
"Bid?" Teng Qingshan chuckled and looked at Huo Yan, "Purple light cold iron is a treasure of refining weapons, I will use it in exchange for silver?"
Huo Yan smiled awkwardly.
"I don't sell, only trade!" Teng Qingshan looked at Huo Yan.
"I don't know what baby to change?" Huo Yan asked.
"Star Pattern Steel!" Teng Qingshan said, "My Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel has seven kilograms and two taels. I am going to exchange 110 kilograms of Star Pattern Steel. Of course, Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel is far more than this price. The price difference, you use gold Or silver notes to make up." Teng Qingshan said very simply.
Huo Yan groaned: "Seven catties and two taels...I can give you 110 catties of Star Pattern Steel from Wan Xiang Tower, plus 500 taels of Yang's Salt gold notes! Brother Qin Lang, what do you think of this price?"
According to the price of 20 catties of gold per catty of purple light and cold iron. The price Huo Yan gave was much higher.
"This Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel is much more valuable than the Star Pattern Steel. There is no market! The price you give is lower." Teng Qingshan smiled lightly.
Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, no stronghold one cannot overcome, this kind of special surname, many Inner Strength masters are yearn for sth even in one's dreams have such weapons. Since there is no market, Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, the real transaction price, one catty of purple light cold iron, should far exceed twenty catties of gold. Moreover, the selling price of Star Pattern Steel in Wan Xiang Tower is "one tael of Star Pattern Steel and one tael of gold", so the purchase cost of Wan Xiang Tower, Star Pattern Steel is cheaper than gold.
"This..." Huo Yan hesitated slightly, then gritted his teeth, "110 Jin Star Pattern Steel, plus 600 taels of Yang's Salt gold notes. This is the highest price I can offer."
"Very good." Teng Qingshan nodded, "However, please exchange these gold notes into gold bars. I don't like using gold notes."
"It's okay." Huo Yan said. When you go to the bank to exchange, you need to pay a little storage fee. Wan Xiang Tower hasn't thought about it to that point. "However, brother Qin Lang, you should also understand that this is in Wan in Yi City. Xiang Tower does not have so many Star Pattern Steel stocks."
"I understand this." Teng Qingshan smiled lightly, "How long will you take, ready?"
"I will send someone to Jiangning County, three hundred miles away, overnight, and I will be ready at this time tomorrow," Huo Yan said.
"You can have a place to stay. I'll just wait for you." Teng Qingshan smiled lightly.
The two guards looked at each other and admired secretly in their hearts. If you dare to live in Wan Xiang Tower, you are not afraid that Wan Xiang Tower will kill people secretly.
"That's okay." Huo Yan smiled, "This Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel, Brother Qin Lang is still in your custody. At this time tomorrow, we will trade again."
Behind Wan Xiang Tower, there is a large courtyard and a large number of houses. The guards, maids and Huo Yan Landlord of Wan Xiang Tower live here. Teng Qingshan was also arranged in a very exquisitely furnished room. If it's a big inn, this class of room is definitely a Tianzi room.
In the evening, Wan Xiang Tower was closed.
In the empty courtyard behind Wan Xiang Tower, many guards are learning martial arts here.
"Brother Qin Lang, look, how about their Sword Art?" Huo Yan and Teng Qingshan stood side by side in the corridor.
Teng Qingshan took a look and smiled: "Wanxiang Sect's Sword Art is very extraordinary. I have also seen Wanxiang Sect's master hand. The Sword Art is as fast as lightning and swift. But the Sword Art of these disciples has nothing to do with it. Unexpectedly! It is estimated that it has not undergone real life and death training."
Those men and women, looking at Teng Qingshan, have a hint of unhappiness.
Young people are very arrogant, how can they be satisfied if they are so evaluated?
"Brother Qin Lang, why don't you give some pointers to these younger juniors?" Huo Yan smiled.
"It's been a long time since I moved my muscles and bones." Teng Qingshan walked down the corridor with a chuckle.
The senior brother of the security guard headed his hand and said, "Please."
"Let's go together." Teng Qingshan said calmly.
The faces of those martial brothers changed drastically, this ‘Qin Lang’ was so rampant! Huo Yan in the corridor changed his expression, and then laughed loudly: "If you miss the opportunity to give guidance, you can never have it. Just ask Qin Lang for advice. If you lose, you won't be ashamed."
"Look at the sword." A young girl who was hit by Teng Qingshan at noon was already angry and screamed. The first one to hold the sword was to fly and stab Teng Qingshan straight. The big senior brother followed at the same time, and the long sword in his hand turned into three sword shadows, covering Teng Qingshan's head.
The two teamed up to strike.
Teng Qingshan stood in place, watching the two long swords pierce, his eyes condensed, his right hand like lightning.
Cang! Cang! With two crisp sounds, the two long swords were bounced off at the same time and fell to the ground.
The girl and the big senior brother both trembled their right hands and looked at Teng Qingshan in shock. The martial brothers and sisters who saw this scene around were even dumbstruck. The big senior brother is the strongest among them, and the girl is also an Inner Strength master. The other party didn't even draw the sword, but flicked the sword flying with his fingers.
What a powerful finger! What a strong vision!
"Stab the sword, my heart is uncertain, my hand is unstable, and I want to kill the enemy? You don't need to practice the complicated Sword Art. I stabbing a thousand times a day is the most basic." Teng Qingshan glanced at the girl. Then he looked at the big senior brother, "As for you, the basics are laid down first, and the strength is distributed to the three sword shadows. The only consequence is that the three sword shadows are weak! For those who are weaker than you, you don’t need to This trick can also win. And if you are better than you, you can tell the truth of this sword art at a glance."
The eyes of this group of young men and women were bright, they looked at Teng Qingshan a little admiringly, and listened carefully to these evaluations. They are just peripheral disciples of Wanxiang Sect, and it's rare to get expert guidance. In their eyes, they have regarded Teng Qingshan as a super master. A master who is better than their master.
Without drawing a knife, using your fingers to flick two swords, this strength is definitely the pinnacle of Postliminary Realm.
Teng Qingshan's previous life is the Grandmaster of Xingyi. In this life, he reached the realm of the unity of man and gun before the age of ten. I don't know how much better than these men and women who have not experienced much blood.
"Haha, Brother Qin Lang's fingering is simple and quick, but very powerful. I don't know how powerful Qin Lang's swordsmanship is." Huo Yan laughed, "I can get to know Brother Qin Lang, I Huo Yan is also very happy, the banquet is ready, I will definitely have a few drinks with Qin Lang brother."
Teng Qingshan smiled, and walked away with Huo Yan, leaving only the group of young men and women discussing spiritedly, amazed.

Chapter 51: An Iron Bowl
To apply for "civil servant" positions in public institutions, individuals had to take recruitment tests. There were some companies and positions that didn't require test scores for people with special skills, however. When public universities, public hospitals, or scientific research institutions were seeking high-level workers, academic-based manpower, or academic leaders, they would help organize personnel, while also offering housing, arrange job for the workers' spouses, transferring children to another school, etc.
Coaching also required special talent. Every year the provincial sport team would offer test-free recruitment to new talent. Moreover, the sports team belonged to the Provincial Sport Bureau, which was a provincial institution. Working as a coach for the team was obviously superior to county-level sport teams.
When Coach Xu had said that he was capable of interfering with the sports team's recruitment procedures, he was not bragging. Maybe to some people being a sports coach held no value in the real world. In actuality, however, it was the opposite. Especially when one became a chief coach, he or she could take charge of a lot of things alone, and have much more power than the average person thought. Think about coaches from national teams—they lived in big houses, drove expensive cars, and enjoyed a lot of benefits.
Coach Xu was the chief coach of the provincial swimming team, and he had even helped Feifei Yu grow into the world champion. Around the nation there were only a few world champions, and on average there was only one world record holder across several provinces, which was quite low. Therefore, Coach Xu was at the top among all the coaches in the Hanbei Province, making him very respectable and powerful.
Coach Xu may not have been powerful enough to directly get a formally organized personnel, but he could recommend talent to superiors. If it was some other coach's recommendation, it might have been disregarded, but Coach Xu's words were quite powerful. He had coached the world's top swimmers, which had proved his knack for spotting talent. His recommendation was weighed heavily.
Social status mattered. Take online novels, for example: if a newbie's work could receive a famous author's recommendation, then both readers and other authors would think highly of them; if the referrer was not known by many people, then his recommendation would probably be useless.
Coach Xu knew that if Dai Li hadn't offered his help, Feifei Yu would probably have been destroyed. To pay Li back, he tried his best to work things out. He used his reputation to his advantage. Soon after that, Coach Xu heard great news—his recommendation was valued highly by a sub-administration vice-director of the Sport Bureau.
The next day, Coach Xu want to meet this vice-director.
"Xu, you know I trust you. But this Dai Li, he is so young! His resume shows that he just graduated last year!" said the vice-director.
"Director, don't you worry about that. I took time to recommend him because he is still very young and worth cultivating. Just like with Feifei, I recruited her when she was only five, then at fourteen she won her first world championship." Xu paused for a second, then continued, "According to what I have heard, Dai Li was not employed through normal procedure, he was introduced into the sport university by Coach Yuejin Chen. You know if Chen likes him then he must be a good one."
The vice-director nodded in affirmation. He also knew Coach Chen pretty well. If Chen had taken note of Li's ability and had brought him here to Qingcheng City, coupled with Xu's recommendation, then it proved that Li was a competent person.
The vice-director remained silent for several seconds, then asked Xu, " I saw on Li's resume that his special talent is to help "maintain weight," what does that mean?"
"It's 'helping athletes maintain weight.'" Coach Xu hesitated for a few seconds, then leaned towards the vice-director and said, "Director, there is something that I must report. Did you hear a few days ago that Feifei was going to be fired by the national team?"
"Yes, I heard that. It was gossip, wasn't it? You were the one who held the news publication," said the vice-director.
Coach Xu lowered his voice. "Actually, not all of the gossip was wrong. Part of it was true."
"What do you mean?" the vice-president frowned.
"The part about her weight was true. Feifei Yu did weigh 70 kg at that time, and nobody could help. But it was this Dai Li who helped her lose 15kg! That was why we dared to let Feifei do the weighing on the spot. Li is very good at maintaining athletes' weight." Xu leaned forward again, saying, "Until I spoke to the national team's chief coach, Donglai Huo, I did not know that the swimming training center was having a meeting at the same time as I was. Their main discussion was about whether they should fire Feifei or not!"
"How could things be that serious!" The vice-director swallowed. "Feifei is the golden brand of our province, and is the only world record keeper in the entire province. She is not even 20. If she is fired, her future will be destroyed."
Coach Xu said, "Luckily we had Dai Li. He helped Feifei lose weight successfully. Otherwise we would have been in big trouble. Coach Huo from the national team asked me about what kind of methods we used to lose weight, I didn't tell him. I don't want Li to join the national team."
Coach Xu was pretending that Li was so popular that if the provincial sports team didn't recruit him, then the national team would grab him.
The vice-president seemed to feel the tension. He said, "So many professional coaches on the national team have tried to help Feifei lose weight, but failed to do so. How amazing that this young man did it! He must be competent, and worth further cultivation. We do have places for new employees this year. How about this—I keep his resume, and I will discuss with the other leaders on Monday's party committee meeting. I will let you know the result then."
Hearing this, Coach Xu felt sureness. Once Li's recruitment was mentioned on the party committee meeting, then there would be an 80% probability that Li would get the job.
Dai Li was lying in bed reading online novels on his phone when suddenly his phone rang.
"It's Coach Xu." Li immediately answered the phone call.
"My little brother, here is good news! You are all set! Authorized personnel! Next Monday, bring your person ID and student card, and come register at the Provincial Department of Sports!" said Coach Xu.
"That's great! Thank you so much, Coach Xu!" Li jumped out of his bed. "Authorized personnel" really inspired him.
Xu continued from the other end of the phone, "They gave you the personnel of 'physical training coach,' which means you could be allocated to any team. But I trust you. You will be fine wherever you are!"

Chapter 60: Have You Started?
The part that was different from the last game was that this time that old guy had used the word “challenge.”‘Game’ and ‘challenge’ were certainly not the same. It would be worth deliberating on what the difference was between the two of them.
And “Swordfish Seven.” This could mean ‘level,’ or it could mean ‘degree of difficulty for the challenge.’
He reviewed every detail from his most recent time.
When he got closer, the school of swordfish stopped. Which is to say that the swordfish perception had a certain range. Only if you were to enter the scope of their perception would it set off the so-called ‘challenge.’
They were no longer a school then. When it started there was only one swordfish charging toward him. And after he dodged it, the second swordfish came charging, which he also avoided, then the third swordfish . . .
Until he was being stabbed by the pointy swordfish heads.
All the elements came together, and Chen Mu was finally forming the general concept in his mind. This was a challenge, a dodge and evade kind of challenge, which should be a swordfish-attack dodging game. The first time there was only one swordfish, and if you dodged that, the second swordfish would come charging . . . until there was no way for you to stand it, and you manage to escape from the range of the swordfishes’ perception.
If this was the way it really was, then theoretically there should be two ways to end the challenge. One would be to stick it out until you have dodged all of the swordfish assaults. The other would be to grit one’s teeth and endure, suffering intensive pain.
Of course, the second way might be only theoretical, since Chen Mu didn’t believe that there was anyone who could sustain that kind of pain. It was his nature to persevere, and his perceptual training had also given him a great advantage. Even so, he couldn’t withstand that kind of pain.
As Chen Mu saw it, the crux of the matter was that it was too dangerous.
He didn’t come up with his inferences about the dangers by baseless imagination; they were really there. After he get out of the simple water world, he found that there were seven or eight small red welts over his body, which would be faintly painful if he pressed on them.
What was the maker of that mysterious card trying to do? Chen Mu was baffled every time he thought about that question. Although he had dug out a few of the things in the card, he had never found a clue to that mystery.
What a nerve-wracking thing it was!
Star Academy. A white haired old man, a middle-aged man, and a young woman, were standing side by side. In front of them, two corpses were laid out side by side, the corpses that Wang Ze had shockingly sent back.
“Can you tell how they died?” asked the white haired old man.
The one who answered was the young woman, her face very stern, “It was an assassin from the House of a Hundred Depths. They were killed with at least a grade six black-tu-vine poison sting. The adversary was highly skilled.” She had flowing long hair, black clothes from head to toe, and stood stock still, looking off into the distance like a pale lotus bud.
The middle-aged man’s face changed color, “How did you hear of those black bugs under the Hundred Depths? Could that news have been leaked?” He had a square face, quite dignified, except for looking shocked at the time.
The white-haired man shook his head, “We still don’t know all the particulars.” Looking at the two corpses, he sighed, “I’m afraid that quite a few people will have become suspicious by now. The situation is becoming more and more complicated.”
After thinking a while, he looked at that young woman, “The strength of those with Wang Ze there is a little thin. You go this time and see what you find and then decide.” Then he turned to the middle-aged man, “Gather up some people and go with her. I’m afraid it’s no longer practical to take advantage of secrecy, and open battles are likely to become more frequent.” The young woman looking on was silent.
The middle-aged man asked, “Should I choose students or teachers?”
“Students, mostly from the inner academy, but pick a few from the outer academy, and be sure those few are bold and cautious, but worldly.” The young woman suddenly opened her mouth.
“That’s the way it will be.” The white haired old man said categorically.
“Yes sir, I’ll take care of it.” The middle aged immediately bowed.
“Be careful. You’ll certainly run into some aces from the other academies this time, haha, don’t be too concerned, this can be considered your tempering trial.” The white haired old man turned smilingly toward the young woman, and said . . .
“Don’t worry Madame President.”
This was not any ordinary day, and it was the start of a simmering undercurrent within the Heavenly Federation.
Zuo Tingyi arrived at Mei Da’s place. He had rushed over, having just gotten the news that Professor Mei Da had taken ill.
Professor Mei Da was lying in bed, and the situation was visibly not good. His eyes were sunken, his face thin and pale, and he looked a lot older. Zuo Tingyi took it very badly. Professor Mei Da had started imparting knowledge about card making since he was small, and the two had gone far beyond the ordinary teacher-student relationship.
Finding the doctor, he asked in a low voice, “What is the situation?”
The doctor shook his head, “Not very good.”
“What really happened?” Zuo Tingyi looked very badly off. Professor Mei Da had taken good care of himself, and was quite hale and hearty, how could he have taken so ill like this?
The Doctor answered carefully, “Master Mei Da had been in constant deep thought for a while, and it seems that there was some problem lodged in his mind. He was in an anxious state, which led to a physical imbalance. Master Mei Da was studying so intensively that he wasn’t paying attention to the changes to his health, which led to a rapid deterioration. As you know, his age . . .”
Zuo Tingyi hadn’t heard the last part. His gaze had fallen onto the desk.
There was a half-burned card, and a few “Chance Encounter” card plays. A malevolent fire of sudden rage burst forth in Zuo Tingyi’s chest, as he turned his head and returned to Professor Mei Da’s room.
He went straight to find the household manager, and said to his face, “I don’t care how you do it, but you must find this f***king card master, do you understand?”
Seeing his young master’s ashen face, the household manager replied hurriedly, “Yes, sir!”
All of the Zuo family communication channels started to open up, but the household manager regretted the news that he got. They still had no way to trace out any clues, as their adversary was clearly very shrewd and hadn’t left any valuable clues at all. Finally, someone came up with an idea to simply go to the consignment market and squat there.
That plan needed a lot of manpower, which wasn’t really a problem for the Zuo household. The household manager knew very well that although the young master was normally very mild and urbane and spoke well, once he was enraged, things would get ugly for them.
Zuo Tingyi’s position in the Zuo household was second only to his father, Zuo Tianlin, and he was the only Zuo family heir. At that point, no-one could compete with him.
Each day a large crew of guys in disguises would spread into every corner of the consignment market. According to prior timing, the best time would be when the next installment of “The Legend of Master Shi” was released.
But their adversary seemed to know that there were snares waiting above and below, and never appeared. The gang of guys were all watching anxiously until they had clawed thorough their scalps, one by one raising their bile until the corners of their mouths had blisters.
How could they know that Copper at that time was embroiled in the Victoria event, and basically didn’t have the time to write the screenplay.
And Chen Mu was working over his own stuff.

Chapter 100 - Energy at the Middle of the Branch
If the great spear was not compared to the Long Bo Leg Hair Great Spear, then it was without a doubt a precious spear among all the spears there.
Leg hair? Leg hair! Leg hair?
Two days had passed. In these two days, Wei Xiao Bei had encountered leg hair in his dreams on both days. There were ones that were thousands of feet long along with short ones. There were even ones that had grown faces.
Wei Xiao Bei felt that leg hair almost became his greatest nightmare.
Luckily, he had been training his spear techniques these few days with his master.
Cheng Bi Wu was already 45 years old. He had been training for 38 years and was now at the peak of his life. His martial arts skills were also approaching the peak.
Wei Xiao Bei remembered one time when Cheng Bi Wu got drunk. He had proudly said that when he was 26 years old, he had understood negative jing.
Everyone who knew Guo Shu were aware that a person’s energy was divided into parts. They were roughly known as positive jing, negative jing, and neutral jing. In rough terms, this was how a person used their body’s energy.
In more accurate words, this was a category of Qi usage.
Positive jing was a person’s strength, which was expressed through their fists and kicks. This was the foundation of a martial artist: using their own energy to attack, and making the amount of force they used to be the same as the force applied.
As a result, positive jing was also called the energy at the tip of the branch, which means the energy that was released.
However, a normal person could use 30 percent of their body’s potential. If they punched with their fists, they could exert 40 percent of their arm strength, while kicking would exert 50 percent of their leg strength.
On the other hand, those who have trained their bodies before like soldiers and amateur boxers could use at most 50 percent of their bodies’ potential. They were individuals who were able to exert energy on multiple parts of their bodies at the same time, such as using both forces of the waist and legs simultaneously.
Another step further would be those who could use 80 percent of their bodies. They were people who could combine three different energies on various parts of their bodies at the same time, such as combining the forces of the waist, legs, and fists simultaneously. With such a combination, their fists would be able to make whistling sounds in the air.
The highest realm of positive jing would be a person who could use their body’s full potential. They would not only combine the forces of their legs, waist, and fists but also use special techniques such as Iron Mountain Lean, which utilized the neck and the lower legs.
After positive jing was negative jing. In terms of Guo Shu, negative jing was also called lowered elbow fighting. What did this mean?
In general, it meant that a person must hide the positive jing in the middle section of their body such as the arms and thighs. In this way, a person would be able to attack and defend during fights. It was different from positive jing which only focused on attacking and not defending.
As a result, negative jing was also called the energy at the middle section of the branch. However, negative jing did not increase a person’s strength. A person’s strength still relied on their positive jing.
If a master of negative jing fought with a master of positive jing, it would without a doubt look like a Taiji expert fighting a muscle- headed brute.
Finally, there was neutral jing. Neutral jing was called the energy at the root of the branch. It could bring out a person’s energy from the root section to the middle section and from the middle section to the tip. In order to master neutral jing, a person must store energy all over the body. It could also be counted as an advanced version of negative jing.
A person who trained in neutral jing could store energy anywhere in their body and could release the energy at anytime.
By being able to store and release energy at one’s will, birds should not even think of leaving if they landed on the individual’s  body. The energy released by the person’s body would be able to counteract the force of a bird’s upward movement.
When a person reached this level, even if the opponent hit them, they would be able to easily release energy to counter the incoming punch.
This entirety was called the great way of martial arts. In truth, when a person reached the level of neutral jing, they would be able to feel the similarities in different martial arts such as Taiji and Bajiquan.
An example of a martial art that utilizes neutral jing is Zhang Yi 18 drops.
As a result, this kind of martial arts was only a type of martial arts and could not be considered a realm of martial arts.
From this, it was easy to tell how bad it was to fight against a master of negative jing.
Wei Xiao Bei was not able to see the realm his own master was in, but by training with him, he was able to feel a certain level of oppression that prevented him from exerting energy outward.
Everytime Wei Xiao Bei thrusted his spear, Cheng Bi Wu was able to easily ward off the attack and made a counterattack, forcing Wei Xiao Bei into a tragic state. Even the parts of the body where Wei Xiao Bei focused his energy on was easily seen through by his master.
Wei Xiao Bei was not an idiot. He knew that this was not only because his master was happy in obtaining the treasure but also because he wanted to train him.
Wei Xiao Bei’s strength that was formed by his muscles and sturdiness gave him a total of 17.5 points.
This meant that he was already very strong!
If the possibility of muscle strain was ignored and Wei Xiao Bei used his full strength to the limit, the power in his fists would far surpass the power of the world heavyweight champion.
However, he was only able to use positive jing.
After training for a round, Wei Xiao Bei boldly asked his master this question.
Cheng Bi Wu spoke without any trace of politeness: “Xiao Bei, your understanding towards Bajiquan has far surpassed your third brother. Your second brother is also close to being unable to catch up. However, you are only at the middle level of positive jing. This makes you quite far apart from your big brother.”
This was the reality. Wei Xiao Bei also slightly understood this about himself. He was indeed at the level of mastery in Bajiquan, but in reality, the way he used energy was substandard.
However, sparring with his master in these few days had allowed him to understand ways to use energy more effectively.
He wouldn’t be able to immediately reach a high level in positive jing, but he was able to understand things that he did not understand before.
Apart from this, Wei Xiao Bei had also searched through the internet and found out what the Citizen of Long Bo that he encountered in the Dust World actually was!
There were adult Citizens of Long Bo whose heights reached 300 meters.
The adults of their race were giants.
The Classic of Mountain and Sea had also mentioned them. In ancient times, there was a country called the Country of Long Bo. Every single citizen of the country was an incredibly tall giant. They could walk very far in just a few steps, and their breaths created clouds. Their heads were above the clouds, and the northern seas were their bathtubs.
One day, a citizen of that country went to the sea to fish, but that person carelessly fished out a giant turtle that supported the five mountains of Immortals. As a result, two of those mountains sunk, leaving countless Immortals homeless.
The Celestial Emperor was furious after this event and shrunk the amount of land in their country. This had caused the giants to shrink. However, during the era of the legendary Chinese Emperor and the Farmer God, these giants were taller than 300 meters.
From this, it was easy to tell that a Citizen of Long Bo was a giant.
After looking at this information, Wei Xiao Bei was shocked.
It seems that the Dust World truly had a relation with myths and legends.
After this, Wei Xiao Bei searched the web everyday for an hour before going to sleep. He used this time to familiarize himself with various myths and legends of China. These works included the Classic of Mountain and Sea, Lie Zi, In Search of the Supernatural, Huai Nan Zi, and other Chinese literary works. Every one of them was read by Wei Xiao Bei once.

Chapter 150: Lucky Yu Gangan
Auntie Zhang was a little hesitant. But, Mother Chen and Auntie Liu kept trying to convince her.
In the end, Auntie Zhang agreed and gave her son a phone call, “Son, find surveillance footage of the neighbor’s fight this morning and send it to me...Why are you asking so much? Just send it to me...”
After hanging up the phone, she said to Yu Gangan, “When it arrives in my WeChat, I’ll send it to you.”
Yu Gangan stood up and bowed thankfully, “Thank you. When you come to my clinic in the future, I won’t take a single cent from you.”
“No, I can’t let you make a loss. You need to get paid,” Auntie Zhang said with a smile.
On the side, Auntie Huang suddenly burst into laughter, “Oh, I’m sorry. I just won again.”
Auntie Liu stood up. With her mouth open in laughter, she said, “Old Huang, you didn’t win a single game until Xiao Yu started sitting behind you and you won consecutively.”
Over on another table, Auntie Zhang started waving at Yu Gangan, “Come here, come sit beside me. I haven’t won once today. Let’s see if I win when you sit next to me.”
“It must be a coincidence. Auntie Huang must be lucky,” Yu Gangan said as she sat beside Auntie Zhang. With a smile, she said, “If you don’t win, don’t blame me.”
“It’s fine. If I don’t win then I’ll just consider it a run of bad luck. I’ve already decided to stop playing after I lose all the money on the table...” Before she finished speaking, she picked up a tile and pushed over all the tiles in front of her, “I’m sorry, but I won.”
She stretched out her arms and gently hugged Yu Gangan, “Xiao Yu is so lucky.”
Auntie Zhong waved at Yu Gangan, “Come, sit next to me.”
“What are you in such a rush for? I only won once. You guys have won so much already. Let me win a few more times. Sit back down, sit here,” Auntie Zhang said, stopping Yu Gangan from leaving.
Yu Gangan laughed at the ridiculousness.
This must have been a coincidence. But, after she sat down, Auntie Zhang won the two rounds after that.
As Auntie Zhang counted her money, she asked Yu Gangan with a smile, “Xiao Yu, do you have a boyfriend? My son is still single and he’s an IT genius with an annual salary of over a million dollars. Do you want to consider him?”
If she could marry this lucky woman into her family, how great would that be?
Auntie Zhong discarded a tile and said, “I think my nephew is more suited. He’s handsome and looks just like a celebrity. I think his appearance is more suited to Xiao Yu; they are both good-looking.”
Auntie Zhang glared at her and said in an upset manner, “Are you saying that my son isn’t handsome? How is he not handsome? He’s much more handsome than your nephew!”
On the side, Auntie Liu shook her hands and said, “Stop arguing. I think my son is more suited. Xiao Yu, my son is 25 and he owns his own business. Why don’t I give him a call right now and tell him to come meet you?”
Yu Gangan didn’t know whether to laugh or cry: “...”
Why was everyone trying to match her up with someone?
She immediately grabbed onto Auntie Liu’s hand and said, “No no no...”
At that moment, the door to the club suddenly flew open and a tall, strong man walked in calmly. The lights in the room fell upon his cold and handsome face, like a deity from a mythical legend. His presence was completely intimidating.
Yu Gangan looked at him as though she had found her savior. In response to everyone’s query, she said, “I’m sorry...my friend is here.”

Chapter 350: I Will Conquer The World For You
Xiao Tao became very anxious as she thought that Ning Xi had suffered from the blow of the gossip and could not bring herself to be energetic. She did not have any idea what to do, so she could only follow Ling Zhizhi's orders to function as always and play by ear.
Today's main highlight would definitely be Ning Xueluo, so Ling Zhizhi's only request to Ning Xi today was only one word, "stable".
Ning Xi painted her face with makeup decently, not wanting to stand out, and she wore a champagne colored Chanel gown from the latest fall/winter collection.
The dinner was held at Imperial's only six-star hotel.
Ning Xi had reached a little early and saw that all around her were busy crew members still decorating the area. It was filled with red roses and heart-shaped balloons. It would have to take a blind person to ignore that these were clearly preparations for a marriage proposal.
Apart from that, the hotel was also filled with all sorts of gift baskets. They were from collaboration companies and fans. It was so full that there was almost nowhere to walk.
Ning Xi briefly skimmed the lavish gifts and saw that at the corner was a gift basket labeled, "Ning Xi's Global Fan Club". Her heart was warmed.
She even had a fan club now...
Even though it was not much compared to Ning Xueluo and Zhao Sizhou's gifts, she was already very happy.
However, Xiao Tao clearly felt disappointed. She thought about how few gifts Ning Xi received. How stingy of them! When the reporters see this later, they wouldn't even know what to write!
She recalled with a sigh that when she used to attend to Leng Manyun, every launch dinner of hers was filled with mountains of gifts.
Now she might even be shamed together with Ning Xi, for even someone of Ning Xueluo's status to overshadow them. Her friends were going places in this industry but only she went from being at the peak of everyone's envy to the bottom of the pit. The more she thought about it, the sadder she got...
This was when Fang Ya and the bunch started to make an entrance with lots of noise.
"Wah! The place is decorated so beautifully! This is too dreamy!"
"I wonder how much all these cost! Even just booking the entire hotel would cost an astronomical sum already! The hotel really earned it this time!"
"Come on. The latest most popular female actress and the man with the highest net worth are romantically making a pact of their love here. With such a sensational news, this hotel could use it to promote itself too. Of course, they wouldn't miss this opportunity!"
When the crowd was done with their oohing and aahing, they all giggled with their hands covering their mouths as they looked at Ning Xi's little fan-gifted gift basket.
"What's this that Ning Xi's fan gave her? Just a little gift basket?"
"Why is she standing there then? She wouldn't be looking for that pleb's surprise, would she?"
"Expecting something from that weirdo? She must have been too provoked by Xueluo..."
Fang Ya's face was full of delight as she looked at Ning Xi and she arrogantly repeated the words from the other night, "Sigh, if there was nothing to compare to, there wouldn’t be any hard feelings now!"
When she heard such a piercing insult, Xiao Tao could not tolerate it any longer and she was so angry that she cried on the spot, "These people are too mean! How can they do this?"
Ning Xi sighed and touched Xiao Tao's head. She said softly, "Xiao Tao, be good. This is only temporary. I won't let you suffer with me! One day, I will conquer the world for you!"
Xiao Tao instantly laughed through her tears, as she said with red cheeks, "Sis Xi, I hate you! You're teasing me again!"
Seeing the girl laugh, Ning Xi was finally relieved.
Actually, she was fine with being unhappy for a short while. Such a petty thing was really nothing to her. But what she could not stand most was to let the people around her suffer with her, because of her.

Chapter 351: Iron Chef William Fee
Night arrived and the hall was lit brightly.
The drama team's core production members, partners, and media members entered the venue.
As they explored the huge banquet hall to network, the drama team's members glowed in pride.
"My God! This is too amazing! Have you seen any other launching dinner this grand? I must take more pictures to make my friends jealous!"
"Haha, then I might as well directly start a live feed! I think it would get many views!"
"This time we've all got Xueluo to thank for!"
"Right, where's Xueluo herself? Is she here yet?"
"What's the rush? Of course, the lead character must make a grand final entrance!"
As soon as that was said, Ning Xueluo, who was dressed in a body-hugging white dress with a train, walked in gracefully while being surrounded by the media.
Fang Ya and the rest immediately went up to her. 
Fang Ya clung onto Ning Xueluo's arm in a friendly way and said, "Xueluo, you're finally here! You look so pretty today!"
Ning Xueluo looked at her and said radiantly, "Nah, just the usual!"
Everyone around her started to compliment her one after another, "Xueluo, your outfit today is really gorgeous! It's so elegant and your figure looks so good!"
"Ah, what do you lot know? It's not about the dress, it's the glow of love!" someone else added.
Ning Xueluo covered her face teasingly and said, "You guys are laughing at me again!"
Fang Ya intentionally picked up a spoon to pretend it was a mic and started mock interviewing, "Miss Ning Xueluo, I'd like to interview you for a little. How do you feel like, having such a perfect boyfriend?"
Ning Xueluo smiled sweetly, "Stop messing around! Everyone, eat more tonight. Su Yan has specially invited a three star Michelin chef from Hong Sing!"
The crowd instantly exclaimed, "Wow! Michelin! And three star too! My God! Your Su Yan is too generous, how much would this meal cost?"
"A Michelin star invited from Hong Sing? Could it be William Fee?"
As Ning Xueluo listened to the crowd's exclamation, she pretended to nonchalantly look towards Ning Xi's direction and casually answered, "It's him. The other day I saw him in a magazine and just casually mentioned him. Who knew? Su Yan really did manage to invite him over."
All the girls around were jealous...
"Ah! Please have pity on us single ones and stop showing off your perfect boyfriend!"
"Please, even if you had someone, you wouldn't be as loving as them!"
Ning Xueluo looked at them and said, "Alright, that's enough for now! You guys have fun, I'm going over there for a bit."
"Okay, okay, stop talking to us. Go look for your Su Yan!"
Xiao Tao who was accompanying Ning Xi in the corner was so angry that her spoon was almost bent from her incessant hands fiddling and bending it. "Damn it, damn it, damn it! They actually invited the Iron Chef William Fee! My biggest wish is to enjoy a meal cooked by him! Who knew it would happen under such circumstances! This is making me lose my appetite..."
"William Fee..." Ning Xi seemed to mumble absentmindedly.
"Yeah!" Xiao Tao said with much gusto, "If you don't know William Fee, you should know Alain Passa, right? He's the head chef at France's top Michelin restaurant! William Fee is his student and he's especially famous and very difficult to book. To enjoy such a meal, commoners like me would go bankrupt to afford it!"
Ning Xi listened and did not say anything. Of course, she knew William Fee.
Many years ago, there was a time when she loved to watch the Masterchef TV series. Her favourite chef was called William Fee, and every day after school she would drool in front of the television screen. At that time, Su Yan had teased her and said, "Just you wait for the day of our wedding banquet. I'll invite William Fee to cook for us!"
Hah, who knew it would be this painful to look back into the past...

Two days later, Fang Zhengzhi prepared to journey to the River of Trust Capital to participate in the capital examination.
Compared to the previously time when he left quietly, this time, when they heard the news that Fang Zhengzhi was leaving, the entire village rushed over in the early morning.
Stuffing food and drinks of all kinds into Fang Zhengzhi’s bag.
"Zhengzhi, don’t worry! You have the village to take care of you, it doesn’t matter whether you pass the capital examination. Whatever Double Roll Champion, don’t think too much, just do your best!"
"Yes! What’s important is that you do your best. You are young and still have many years ahead of you!"
Qin Xuelian swept her gaze across the chatty villagers, then, placed the bundle she wrapped onto the Silver Scale Horse and walked in front of Fang Zhengzhi.
"Zhengzhi, do your best! Even if you don’t pass, don’t feel embarrassed! Is that clear?"
Fang Zhengzhi was rather gloomy. He had already attained Double Roll Champion, why didn’t his own mother believe in him? He was her blood son!
But, he instantly understood.
Just like the first time he went hunting on the mountain, Qin Xuelian didn’t expect him to be able to hunt something. All she wanted the word "safety", hence, she didn’t want Fang Zhengzhi to have any stress at all.
Maybe, this was the true love a mother showed to her son, a selfless love.
"Zhengzhi, take care on the way!" Fang Houde stood beside the Silver Scale Horse and fed the horse feed into the horse’s mouth, and used his remaining hand to caress the Silver Scale Horse. His expression was that of heavy reluctance and unwillingness to let go.
A father, no matter how reluctant he was, cannot reveal it. Maybe, Fang Houde was someone like that. He would rather express his unwillingness to the Silver Scale Horse.
After bidding goodbye to the villagers, he was stopped once again at the village entrance by Zhang Yangping.
"Take these pieces of silver, you would definitely have to spend some along the way, don’t be too prudent!" Zhang Yangping threw over a bulging wallet.
Fang Zhengzhi didn’t reject it. Even though he still had a hundred tael silver note in his pocket, but this wallet represented the hope Zhang Yangping had in him.
"Thank you Uncle Yangping!" Fang Zhengzhi expressed his thanks.
"Go on!" Zhang Yangping waved his hands.
Fang Zhengzhi pulled on the horse reins. The Silver Scale Horse neighed loudly and galloped forward.
"You must remember, even if you can’t pass this capital examination, it’s alright! The entire village and I will always support you! Don’t be embarrassed to return!"
Zhang Yangping’s shouts came from behind him.
On the other hand, Fang Zhengzhi twitched his mouth. What ’being unable to pass’?
Normally, among examinees there was the culture of being accompanied on the way to the examination. This was not only because they could take care of one another, but also due to safety.
From the Huai An County to the River of Trust Capital, it required half a month on horseback, and along the way were many mountain paths and barren lands.
Due to being delayed for a few days at the Huai An County, and then making a return trip back to the Northern Mountain Village, hence was rather rushed for time.
When he managed to return to the Huai An County, most of the examinees had already formed groups and left.
Left without a choice, he could only ride alone.
Wilding galloping all the way, clouds of dust were raised behind him. His luck was indeed rather good, only after galloping for eight days did he meet a group of mountain bandit robbers.
"Robbery!" A few bandits wielding sabres blocked Fang Zhengzhi’s path.
At the same time those few bandits opened their mouth, over ten bandits with their bows drawn appeared from the bushes on both sides of the mountain road, each of their metal bows pulled into the shape of a full moon.
Arrows glowing with an icy glint aimed directly at Fang Zhengzhi’s throat.
Maybe, Fang Zhengzhi only needed to say the word "no" for him to understand the bitter beauty of an arrow rain...
Just as Fang Zhengzhi was being robbed, the River of Trust Capital was exploding with activity.
The River of Trust Capital was the source of the River of Trust, backed by a tall mountain. On the mountain was a large green pool, its name was Serene Ink Pond. It was the source of the River of Trust, and a white jade statue was constructed in the middle of the pond, set quietly in the pond and being bowed to by scholars from every place.
And today, the countless scholars dressed in brocade clothes gathered around the Serene Ink Pond.
Some were smiling, walking along calmly and occasionally drinking a mouth of pond water and singing a few words of praise. Some sat down gracefully, admiring the mountains, the water, and the flow of people.
Water, was the soul of All Creation.Anywhere there was water, naturally there would be ancient and elegantly-constructed restaurants.
It only had to hang up a few words of poems like "The Serene Ink Pond’s unique water, high on the mountains, were people" in order to cause all the scholars to gather. Even though the price was many times higher, it couldn’t affect their refined and elegant attitude of minds.
Yan Xiu, wearing his brocade robe, was different from the group of scholars visiting the Serene Ink Pond. Even though he didn’t paint nor recite poetry like those scholars, but, he had money.
Hence, the best sightseeing garret at the Serene Ink Pond was occupied by him. And he even reserved it for an entire month at one go.
After following someone for a long enough time, his personality would be more or less affected by him. For example, the strong bearded man’s current manner was silent, neither happy nor angry.
Of course, compared to Yan Xiu’s coldness, the strong bearded man’s success still lacked behind a little.
Within the garret, a maid sat respectfully in front of the table. Her hands flew about, pouring tea for Yan Xiu. On the other hand, Yan Xiu was gazing coldly at the scholars appearing non-stop by the Serene Ink Pond’s sight.
Below the garret, at a rather lively table, a few brocade-clothed scholars bobbed their heads and discussed excitedly.
"Quick look, another person from the Hidden Dragon Roll arrived at the River of Trust Capital!"
"Are you talking about Kang Xingping? Even though Kang Xingping is number eighty in the Hidden Dragon Roll, but, compared to those few at the River of Trust Capital now, the difference is still huge!"
"Indeed, I never thought that just a capital examination would attract so many people from faraway lands to participate! Tang Yucheng, number thirty-five in the Hidden Dragon Roll, with the enlightenment state of Divine Seal Peak State. And Zhang Hetong, number twenty-eight with the enlightenment state of Divine Seal Peak State two years ago. I heard that he had already touched the threshold of the Star Conglomerate State."
"Especially that Hua Kangan! Number twenty on the Hidden Dragon Roll, with the enlightenment state of the Star Conglomerate State. At the same time, his name is also on the Rising Dragon Roll! Who would have thought that he would actually come to the River of Trust!"
The few scholars sighed heavily as they discussed.
"Looks like this time’s River of Trust Capital examinations wouldn’t be easy to pass. Even I wish to change to some other capital. Taking the examination in this River of Trust capital is really a form of torture!"
"This thought is good, but changing capital now? How do you change? Just the distance alone is too long to make it in time! Furthermore, even though the number of participants in this time’s River of Trust Capital is large, but, the good thing is that this is a very rare occasion! Else why do you think all these people would all come to the River of Trust Capital?"
"Brother Li is indeed right, ha ha ha... I was just making a joke, if we didn’t want to try, why would we be here?"
Yan Xiu quietly sat in the garret and listened. His expression was cold, and he didn’t speak a word. He also didn’t bother paying any attention to the maid pouring his tea. But, he instinctively tightened the grip on the Golden Bone Silver Thread Fan in his hands.
