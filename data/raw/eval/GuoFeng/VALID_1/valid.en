Chapter 110: Strength comes from Oppai
“Phew!” Shi Xiaobai exhaled the deep breath he had held in as he gradually opened up his eyes. The first thing he saw was Riko’s beautiful but nervous face.
“How is it? How much information did you get?” Riko was feeling uneasy since the repeat of the awakening dream was brief. It only skimmed the surface, so the information gained about the superpower would be greatly lacking.
However, the amount of information obtained would determine how difficult it was to reproduce the entire superpower blueprint.
Shi Xiaobai answered, “This King roughly knows what his superpower is.”
“Really?” Riko was delighted as she asked, “Quick, tell me about the information you gathered.” Shi Xiaobai said, “Strength. This King can obtain the strength of others.”
Riko was surprised as she asked, “Huh? Anymore?”
Shi Xiaobai cocked his head and gave it some thought before he threw up his hands and said, “That was it.”
Riko stared widely. “What do you mean that was it?”
Riko gave a faint sigh. Although she should not have expected to obtain much information from the repeat of the awakening dream, she had never expected that all he got was such vague information.
To be able to obtain powers from others meant that it was the effect, but what about the condition to obtain strength? What sort of limitations would there be to obtain strength from others?
To be able to use his superpower freely, he had to be extremely clear of the three rules, namely, effects, conditions and limitations. A complete superpower blueprint was extremely important.
The information Shi Xiaobai had obtained was just a tip of an iceberg, it might even not be able to amount to the tip of an iceberg.
However, Riko knew it was not the time to grumble over this. It was all her fault, so she had to restore Shi Xiaobai’s perfect superpower blueprint or she would never feel at ease.
“Do you know how to obtain powers from others? For example, must you do a specific move or do certain things?” Riko made an attempted guess.
Shi Xiaobai was momentarily taken aback before he pondered for a while. Then, he nodded and said, “This King seems to know how.”
Indeed, he had a vague idea how to obtain the strength of others in his mind.
“Really?” Riko was pleasantly surprised to hear this. As long as the method to use the superpower was known, she could figure out the superpower blueprint by constant experimentation. She hurriedly said, “Then quick give it a try! Well, you can use me as the target. Obtain your power from my body!”
It was actually a very dangerous thing to be the target of a superpower experiment. Only the Heavens knew what strength really meant. It was unknown if it would harm her body if her strength was taken away or if her strength could be restored or if the superpower could be returned.
However, Riko could not care so much. She blamed herself for everything that had happened, so she believed she had the responsibility to become Shi Xiaobai’s experimental subject. She had to take responsibility for this matter, regardless of the price.
“Are you sure?”Shi Xiaobai asked with knitted brows. He had a nagging feeling that the method to obtaining power was somewhat…
Riko felt a thump in her heart upon hearing this. She knew that with Shi Xiaobai’s character, it was unlikely he would ask such a question. Being direct was his style, but with him asking, it proved that the usage of the superpower was extremely damaging to the target.
There was a struggle in Riko’s eyes but it quickly calmed down. She took a deep breath and said seriously, “I’m sure. Come on!”
Riko puffed up her chest, indicating that she did not mind sacrificing herself.
“Alright, then This King won’t stand on ceremony.” Shi Xiaobai did not hesitate any further. Being direct was definitely his style. Shi Xiaobai slowly reached out his right hand towards Riko.
While Riko looked at the right hand that was gradually approaching her, she could not help but feel nervous. Even though she told herself that she was willing to sacrifice herself, it was common for humans to fear the unknown.
Riko closed her eyes with a bit of apprehension. She began cheering on herself in her mind. Come on, even if it will result in excruciating pain when strength is extracted, that is the responsibility you have to bear! Riko closed her eyes tightly as she held her breath. She nervously waited for Shi Xiaobai to use his superpower on her.
Suddenly, Riko was horrified to find her perky, left breast being grabbed by someone! That holy ground of softness had been grabbed gently with five fingers making full contact with it. A numbness immediately spread throughout her body!
“Ah!”Having her breast attacked, Riko gave out an instinctive yelp as she hurriedly jumped back and covered her chest with her hands. She stared in disbelief at Shi Xiaobai’s wandering hands that had yet retracted from its grip.
“Why!?” Riko looked at a blinking Shi Xiaobai that had a completely pure expression. She could not believe that he had used such a shameless method to desecrate the holy land that no one else had ever touched!
Riko’s face blushed red as her eyes began to slightly swell in redness. “I have always thought of you as a good person. I never expected you to be such a Shi Xiaobai!”
Riko was both embarrassed and furious. Even if she had made a mistake, it was unintentional. Besides, she had been doing her best to make up for it. Why did he treat her like that? Why did he use such a humiliating way to take his revenge on her?
“Strength!” Shi Xiaobai suddenly reached out his hand as he pointed at Riko’s covered chest. He calmly said, “Didn’t you allow This King to obtain strength from your body? Strength is in there!”
Upon hearing this, Riko stood open-eyed and agape with speechless astonishment. Shi Xiaobai’s superpower usage target was female breasts?
Minutes later, after Shi Xiaobai’s perplexing explanation, Riko finally managed to calm down. However, her cheeks were still as red as an apple.
“So, the strength you want to obtain is in my…cough, there?” Riko was so embarrassed that she could not even bring up the matter. She had yet to engage in the worldly pleasures, and she was even a pure and innocent girl who had never even dated. So how could she bring up the matter for discussion after having her sensitive spot grabbed?
Shi Xiaobai nodded and said, “That’s right.”
“Hu, why didn’t you tell me earlier!” Riko began knitting her eyebrows.
“You didn’t ask.” Shi Xiaobai said matter-of-factly.
Riko was stunned silent. Indeed, she did not ask in her nervousness, but don’t you know that you need to ask for someone’s opinion if you were grabbing that spot? Do you know what is sexual harassment?
Hmph, this bastard must be doing it on purpose. He is nothing but a young pervert! Riko cursed in her heart as she said with a bitter face, “Must…you grab there to be able to use your superpower?”
Wasn’t this superpower limitation too fucked up? It could only be used by grabbing a girl’s breast?If that was the case, how was she to become his experimental subject…?She had nearly suffered a mental breakdown when her breast was grabbed without any warning. If they had to repeat the experiment, wouldn’t she die of embarrassment?
Shi Xiaobai thought for a moment and said, “It seems like it just needs to be close.”
“What!?”Riko stared widely as she boomed angrily, “Then why did you grab my boo…there!” Riko reached out her hands to press down on Shi Xiaobai’s shoulders, her eyes burning with flames.
“Because…This King was very curious!” Shi Xiaobai said in dead seriousness.

Chapter 180: The Monarch’s No. 1 Beauty (1)
Curls of pale smoke were rising from an incense burner in a room enveloped in silence. There was an ancient semi-enclosed bed there, carved with exquisite and complex patterns. It was covered with fine gauze, which vaguely outlined the lithe and graceful figure of a woman.
After understanding the situation, Yu Chu’s heart was mixed with hope and fear. The good news was that this was a female-dominated society. Being a woman had many benefits in this world where women were superior to men. However, there was one thing to worry about; the original host’s reputation was extremely bad…
As she got up from the bed, her shadow was reflected on a folding screen in the inner room. Outside the veiled bed was a resplendently decorated room.
The attendant who was waiting outside immediately bowed and came in with lithe footsteps. His head was lowered as he nervously asked in a slightly husky voice, “Your Highness, you’re awake?”
Yu Chu looked up to size him up. She noticed that he was quite good-looking, with delicate features. His humble attitude made him appear very docile. On the one hand, he feared her but on the other hand, he proceeded with caution to please her. This is how it feels to be revered as a woman, huh?
Yu Chu secretly sucked in a deep breath. As she thought about the original host’s usual temperament, she half-leaned on the bed and lazily waved her hand. “You can leave.”
The young man froze. Typically speaking, when a noblewoman like her woke up, attendants had to stay there and wait upon them. Moreover, most noblewomen usually kept several likable attendants at their side to wait upon them and let them take care of all kinds of matters.
It was especially true for someone of noble status like the Third Imperial Princess, who led a dissipated life… Generally speaking, when it came to these women of noble status, not only did these attendants wait upon them, but it was also quite normal for these noblewomen to take some liberties with them. As the young man inexplicably got dismissed, he couldn’t help but raise his head and sweep a glance at the Third Imperial Princess on the bed.
She was half lying on the bed, her eyes slightly squinted. That half-sober gorgeous countenance gave off a languid feeling. He didn’t know why, but his heart suddenly skipped a beat at that beautiful sight. The young man hurriedly lowered his head, his face flushed scarlet.
It wasn’t like it was his first time waiting upon the Third Imperial Princess, but he’d never felt that she was this attractive in the past…
The Third Imperial Princess had stunning features, and in the whole Capital there was no woman prettier than her, but it just so happened that she was dissolute and a good-for-nothing.
If someone was genuinely uncouth, then others wouldn’t find them attractive no matter how good-looking they were. Therefore, the men living in the Capital were avoiding her at all costs, and no one wanted to provoke her.
The young man was naturally nervous and helpless, thinking that he would be molested by the Third Imperial Princess again, but he didn’t consider escaping. After all, he was only a servant unlike those noble princes and noblemen, who had a choice to choose their own wives and masters.
Normally, as servants, if they were favored by an Imperial Princess, they would do their best to curry favor with her. If by chance they were taken in as a second husband afterward, it was already considered their greatest blessing.
Since he was dismissed today, he had less opportunity to please the Imperial Princess. However, truthfully speaking, even though his status was that of a lowly attendant, he had also dreamed of having a beautiful and talented wife or master, and not a wretched good-for-nothing. Therefore, inwardly, he ought to be rejoicing instead…
The young man softly acknowledged with a ‘yes’ before retreating. But for some reason, he halted his steps after withdrawing to the outer room, and unexpectedly swept a glance at the folding screen again.
A delicate and graceful woman’s figure was reflected behind that screen. Her casual and languid movements actually made him feel a little…His face reddened and his heart skipped a beat.
The young man suddenly thought: In fact, the Third Imperial Princess isn’t that bad. Although she’s very dissolute and a good-for-nothing, she’s really good-looking and has a noble identity…
In the future, it’s better for me to do my best to please her. He silently made up his mind and blushed some more. He then lowered his head and stood there in a respectful manner.
Chapter 181: The Monarch’s No. 1 Beauty (2)
Yu Chu naturally wasn’t aware of the attendant’s thoughts. She was just flipping through the original host’s memories, and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Although the original host was wanton, it wasn’t that bad… She’s still a virgin.
She combed through the original host’s memories. The original host’s identity was very honorable in this female-dominated society. She was this dynasty’s Third Imperial Princess. It’s just that her character was poor, and she was a bit useless and dissolute… Other than this, she was still fine, I guess…
The Second Imperial Princess died early, so the Empress had only two daughters left, the Eldest Imperial Princess and Third Imperial Princess. She was relatively strict with the Eldest Imperial Princess, but spoiled her youngest daughter to the skies. The Empress was, thus, the Third Imperial Princess’ biggest supporter.
If it were not for the Empress favoring the original host, the latter would’ve already died many times over by the means of the Eldest Imperial Princess. The original host’s wish was, in fact, related to her eldest sister.
With a wanton and unrestrained character, the original host loved all kinds of handsome men, and never bothered fighting for the throne. She merely wanted to be an idle princess after her eldest sister succeeded the throne. The Eldest Imperial Princess, however, didn’t let her off.
This good eldest sister of hers knew that she loved beautiful men, so she specially sent a gorgeous young man over to seduce her. The Third Imperial Princess was captivated by the young lad’s temperament and beauty, and fell head over heels for him. In the end, she was coaxed into downing a cup of poisoned wine, only to learn the truth right before her death.
The good-looking young man was her eldest sister’s lover and didn’t like her. He was merely playing along with her and feigned civility. And, the sister she’d deeply respected all those years actually wanted her dead. She wasn’t resigned to this outcome.
Her wish was to take revenge on this couple. She wouldn’t let her eldest sister, who killed her for the sake of succession, get the throne in this lifetime. As for the young man, who toyed with her feelings, she would make sure he never got love in this life.
Yu Chu thought: How am I supposed to accomplish this? It was easy for me to stop the succession to the throne, but love? How can I possibly guarantee that the young man would never get love? Didn’t the plot already mention that the two of them were in love with each other?!
Yu Chu transmigrated here at a bad time. At this point in time, the Third Imperial Princess had already fallen in love with the beautiful young man. The Eldest Imperial Princess’ plan to poison her was also already set in motion. Those two must’ve fallen in love long ago!
What a headache. Yu Chu rubbed her head and thought: Then the only way left is to break the two of them apart.
I might as well separate them so that they could never see each other again. This could be considered as preventing the young man from getting love, right? 
She got dressed and swept a glance at the mirror. The original host was truly a great beauty with astounding features.
Though she didn’t want a man to help her get dressed, getting dressed in these ancient attires was actually a laborious and arduous task. Thus, many women in this world didn’t even bother doing it themselves. Therefore, even if Yu Chu wanted to find some personal maids to wait upon her, she wouldn’t find one. 
She had no choice but to recall the attendant. The young man was slender with delicate features. He respectfully attended to her and helped her comb her hair with practiced movements. After a short while, her hair was worn in a bun befitting a noblewoman. He seemingly hesitated for a moment before bashfully saying, “Your Highness, you’re so beautiful…”
He cast her a shy look as he stared at her in the mirror. She was indeed good-looking.
The aesthetics of this female-dominated society was still normal, it wasn’t that women had to be masculine while men had to be feminine.
The formation of this world’s system wasn’t determined by physical strength. It was similar to a matriarchal clan, where reproduction and economic duties were the most important things. Thus, women who could give birth naturally had a higher status than men. They were placed in charge of the state and held power in their hands.
As for the men, although they were fitter than women, the system dictated them to please women. To please them physically and psychologically. They had to have slender and fit appearances that could satisfy the womenfolk, and had to possess the ability to flirt and speak words of love… Only then were they considered good husband material.
Chapter 182: The Monarch’s No. 1 Beauty (3)
Appearance and aesthetic-wise, some women also liked feminine and tender men but in general, the majority of the women preferred slender and stylish masculine men. After all, they could also wait upon them better and satisfy them more in terms of bedroom affairs.
As for the men’s standards towards a woman’s appearance, it was very simple. As long as a woman had stunning features and exquisite curves, it was fine. It would be even better if that person was chic, possessed literary talent, and so on… Countless men would be satisfied with this kind of woman as their wife.
As for the Third Imperial Princess… She always had a look of infatuation when she saw beautiful men, spoiling her original beauty. This time, however, she was totally expressionless, which accentuated her gorgeous features. The outer corners of her eyes were slightly arched, and her looks were so captivating that one didn’t dare to look straight at her.
The young man was slightly stunned. He’d subconsciously blurted out those words of praise. If he said that in front of other noblewomen, this was considered acting out of line. However, he was now in front of the Third Imperial Princess, who loved to flirt with men, so his words ought to please her and provoke her interest.
Yu Chu glanced at him but didn’t reprimand him for acting out of line. The young man was overjoyed, thus he served her more diligently, carefully tightening Yu Chu’s long hair.
By the time he was done waiting upon her, the teasing that he was vaguely looking forward to sadly didn’t happen. He bit his lips and carefully probed, “Your Highness… Are you in a bad mood?”
As a man, and her close attendant, it was normal for him to help sort out her problems and comfort her when she was unhappy. In the past, the Third Imperial Princess enjoyed this kind of gentle and thoughtful service.
But today was evidently different. The Third Imperial Princess didn’t seem to be in a bad mood and she looked the same as usual, but she was much colder to him.
“No.” Even her answer was so simple.
The young man bit his lips and pondered over this carefully before comforting in a low voice, “Your Highness, you needn’t worry. Young Lord Mixin is just a little high-minded, but sooner or later, he will understand Your Highness’ good traits.”
Yu Chu raised an eyebrow. Ye Mixin, the son of the Prime Minister. He was the so-called beautiful young man that cheated the original host of her feelings.
His noble household had raised him into a young lad with excellent bearing and handsome features. His physique was also slender and attractive.
Many women in the Capital secretly coveted him, but because of their noble status, they couldn’t just grab him on the streets and fool around with him. Moreover, he was a proud and arrogant person, so no one had managed to succeed in pursuing him yet.
The Third Imperial Princess was also one of those coveters. Although she didn’t dare to force Ye Mixin to marry her, she relied on her status to shamelessly pursue him. As for the results, it was as one could imagine…
After all, she was an infamous love-struck fool and good-for-nothing in the Capital, so a proud and arrogant nobleman like Ye Mixin naturally disliked her a lot. The person Ye Mixin liked was the talented and good-looking Eldest Imperial Princess, and not someone like the Third Imperial Princess. Not only was she an idler, but she was also a nymphomaniac.
Ye Mixin had completely ignored her at first, but for the sake of the Eldest Imperial Princess’ grand plan, he later endured humiliation and compromised, occasionally giving her some attention. He had never said anything about liking her, but the poor Third Imperial Princess was already satisfied as long as he didn’t ignore her. 
She might have been fickle and loved all kinds of beauties in the past, but after meeting Ye Mixin, she had truly fallen in love with him.
She later understood that Ye Mixin didn’t like her and had already decided to give up, but Ye Mixin had agreed to the Eldest Imperial Princess’ request then and started giving her some attention and treating her well occasionally, which rekindled her hope. In the end, he’d misused her affection to successfully end her life.
He even told her that whenever he had faked a smile to please her, those moments were his greatest humiliation.
Thus, the Third Imperial Princess wasn’t resigned to her fate and hated the couple to the core. She’d never hurt anyone, yet they were cruel enough to trample on her life and dignity. Therefore, she wanted vengeance.
Chapter 183: The Monarch’s No. 1 Beauty (4)
Now, Yu Chu was the one occupying this body, and she didn’t like Ye Mixin. Not to mention that the original host’s wish was to get back at Ye Mixin.
Therefore, when she heard the attendant’s words of comfort, she smirked and languidly said, “He isn’t aware of this princess’ good traits, huh? Well, this princess is also too lazy to show him anything.”
As she stared at her beautiful face in the mirror, the corner of her lips curled upwards into a faintly discernible smile. The hosts’ wishes in the first few realms were too smooth and easy. This realm’s unfulfilled wish was more to her liking.
The attendant, however, instantly froze upon hearing her words. What did I just hear? The Third Imperial Princess, who always stuck to Young Lord Mixin like glue, actually said that she was too lazy to show him her good traits? The attendant’s expression was extremely odd.
The words of praise he’d involuntarily blurted out and the words of comfort from earlier were just said to please her. Truthfully speaking, from what he knew, the Third Imperial Princess didn’t seem to possess any good traits…
To think that Her Highness actually said that she was too lazy to show Young Lord Mixin her good traits… She was just praising herself, yet said it in such a righteous manner.
But… In the mirror, a young girl’s unparalleled face was reflected, and her features were gorgeous to the point of perfection. As he watched her lazily play with the gold hairpin, her small movements tickled his heart and he felt a desire to please her.
The attendant was startled by his own thoughts, and his face grew redder by the second. He bit his lips and continued to slowly comb her hair. Her Highness has probably gotten provoked again.
The thought of the Third Imperial Princess genuinely giving up on Ye Mixin didn’t even cross his mind. Ye Mixin’s good looks and status were unparalleled in this world, and the fact of the Third Imperial Princess stalking him was known all over the Capital. Thus, who would believe it if they were told that she would give up on him? No one.
However, while pondering about it, the attendant felt a subtle joy bubble up in his heart. It is naturally a good thing if the Third Imperial Princess has really given up on Young Lord Mixin.
Young Lord Mixin has a noble status, so if he marries into Her Highness’ residence, he will definitely be a very strict husband. When the time comes, the male concubines would still be okay, but the first thing he’d probably do is to get rid of the attendants with slightly better looks. This wasn’t a good thing.
After he thought about it, he softly said, “Your Highness is right. Your Highness deserves a better man.”
Yu Chu didn’t deny his words. She merely raised an eyebrow and stared at the mirror with a pensive look. 
The attendant then asked, “Is Your Highness going out?”
“Mhmm,” Yu Chu nodded. “I’m going to the palace to pay Mother a visit. You go and get ready.”
“Yes,” the attendant hastily answered.
The carriage of their residence was already luxurious enough, but the original host was a prodigal person, so the decoration was even more exaggerated. In all of the Capital, everyone would be able to recognize this carriage.
The carriage driver was a woman. Yu Chu lifted the curtain and walked into the carriage. The attendant who was waiting upon her also followed her in, respectfully kneeling close by, pouring her tea and water.
Yu Chu initially wanted to kick him out, but then she thought: This is a dynasty where females dominated the society, and it’s as normal for an imperial princess to have a male attendant by her side as it is for a king to have a maid by his side. Thus, if I drove him away, it would seem out of place.
In any case, having one more person here won’t hurt anyway. This attendant was a very keen person, so he wouldn’t bother her. When Yu Chu entered the palace, she met the Empress in her bed-chamber and was affectionately consoled again.
The Empress was truly fond of her youngest daughter. She knew that her daughter liked beautiful men, and helped her take note of them.
Seeing her daughter coming over at this moment, the Empress called out a few and lovingly motioned Yu Chu to choose whomever she wanted.
Yu Chu felt as if her head was about to explode. As she sized the group of beautiful men up, she heard the Empress say in a serious tone, “Daughter, you are already eighteen this year…”

The Dean Has Arrived Chapter 240: The pure white sanctuary
The streamlined airship jumped out of the clouds, and the wide metal wings pulled out white airplane clouds in the blue sky. (m)////, the novel is faster and better..
It is mounted on the back end of the empty boat, and the operating magic furnace produces countless colorful particles, which are ejected through the mouth of the empty boat’s tail, which looks like the tail feathers of a phoenix. The airplane cloud is like a picture drawn with the sky as the canvas.
As the flying height of the airship decreased, waves began to appear in the abdomen of the airship as if the boat was traveling in the sea, stirring up circles in the sky.
This is because the nearby atmosphere is rich in sacred auras-although the magic oven does not react with the sacred magic, it will still affect each other to a certain extent.
The appearance of this phenomenon also shows that Xiwei and the others are already within easy reach of the destination sanctuary.
In fact, as long as the windshield in front of the empty boat can see the huge and holy magnificent building ahead.
Sanctuary is not a single castle or church, but a collective name for a large group of buildings. The landmark building is the “New Testament Church”, a huge church that is several hundred meters high and faces the east.
This huge building, which is even printed on the cloak of the paladin troops of the pure white Holy See, is made of white rock. The rock has a vague texture of jade, and it has a different beauty whether it is viewed from close up or from a distance. In addition, dotted on the pure white shell, there are many beautiful stained glass. Almost every piece of glass is made up of tens of thousands of glass pieces of various colors to form a mythical story, which is awe-inspiring. Besides, I can also appreciate the myths and stories that people have circulated, and the unique mystery of stained glass makes the overall beauty of the story rise to a level.
At the top of the church, there is a huge cross, and around the cross, the ring of gold, if there is a substantial halo, the edge of the halo is like the keys of a piano, repeatedly shrinking and popping. (.) Even if Sevi doesn’t know what it is, but the waves of waves emanating from the halo can make him clearly guess that it should be one of the magic items set by the pure white vatican to meet the enemy. NS.
After the airboat circled the sanctuary twice, it slowly stopped in an empty training field that had been reserved.
According to the etiquette, Nero took the initiative to open the hatch for Sivi, but he broke the door twice and failed to open it. So Sivi can only teach him carefully how to turn the doorknob…
Qingyoung coughed to cover up his embarrassment of having an oolong, unscrewed the hatch, and made a gesture to Xiwei.
Xiwei didn’t have stage fright, and walked out generously.
There are already people from the Holy See waiting there on the training ground.
“The Pure White Holy See welcomes you, distinguished Mr. Elidec.” In the middle of the guards of honor on both sides, a fat priest with little hair on his head bent slightly towards Xiwei and made a Bowing: “We have been waiting for a long time.”
Although the fat priest didn’t tell Sivet his identity, his heavy prayer outfit and the red mass robe outside the prayer outfit made Sive guess the identity of the opponent at once.
He should be a cardinal archbishop.
Except for those popes who have abdicated, the cardinals are the most respected under the popes, which can be regarded as one person or more than ten thousand people. Allowing a red archbishop to greet him such a little-known person, and even bow to him-even if the bow is just a gesture-has shown the sincerity of the Holy See.
Be aware that after seeing the attitude of the cardinal archbishop, Nero behind Sivi has froze.
This also makes Siwei feel more puzzled about this: What are these guys who always live in the sanctuary and only care about the gods and come to him?
“You are too polite.” Xiwei nodded to the other party. Since others have given him face, of course he can’t be noble and indifferent in this kind of place-it’s not called pretending, it’s called trying. Moderately expressing kindness to the other party is also part of communication.
“The Pope and the previous Pope are already waiting for you in the New Testament Church. Please move forward for the time being and come to the New Testament Church with me.”
The unnamed red archbishop said with a simple smile on his face, matching the chubby appearance, giving a sense of harmlessness. However, if someone really dared to treat him as a simple and harmless person, that person would definitely suffer a big loss…How could the person standing at the top of the pure white Vatican without any scheming to become a cardinal archbishop?
“Thank you.” Xiwei didn’t say much. He just nodded to the little demon on the airship, and the little demon closed the hatch and started to sail back.
As for Xiwei, there are still a few homecoming crystals in his hand anyway, so there is no need to be afraid of not going back.
As the empty boat slowly ascended, a white shadow suddenly broke through the clouds, smashed down from the sky, and slammed straight beside the empty boat.
After the aroused dust cloud dissipated, the body of the white figure was exposed—it was Nero’s white two-footed dragon, only because he followed the **** of the empty boat all the way to get some rest time No, I have been flying desperately, so now this guy is dressed like an old cow, and there is still white foam dripping from his mouth…
So Nero, who was planning to follow Sevi, could only take care of his mount first.
I don’t know if it’s because of the divine magic power. The plants in the sanctuary are very lush, lush and not messy, full of vitality and seriousness, just right, the feeling of being in it makes Xiwei even a little lingering.
The guard of honour did not follow the cardinal and Xiwei. After walking for a while, the guard of honour disappeared. After all, the status of the guard of honour is not high, so you can’t just enter the magnificent center of the New Testament church. In the building. Therefore, when the huge building of the New Testament Church finally appeared in sight, only Xiwei and the cardinal archbishop were left on the road.
When they finally arrived at the main entrance of the New Testament church, a young girl wearing silver and white full body armor with golden hair tied behind her head was tied with a silver hairpin. out.
The girl saw Xiwei and the Cardinal Archbishop at a glance, but she didn’t say hello, just nodded to them a little, and then continued to leave quickly.
The cardinal archbishop did not show the slightest displeasure~IndoMTL.com~ continued to greet Xiwei into the magnificent building.
Sevi couldn’t help but glance back when he entered the New Testament church.
What he cares about is not the beauty of the girl or the identity of being able to enter and exit the New Testament church, but the kind of breath that faintly exudes from her.
Although it is not obvious, it is faintly similar to the breath of the archangel on the battlefield in the Tower of Grinding.
You must know that since the end of the mythological era, there has been no news in the heavens. If the Holy See really masters the technology to allow angels to descend, then it will be sooner or later that the Qilu mage tower and the king’s council are removed, and it will become the largest power in mankind. It’s up.
However, Xiwei quickly came back to his senses-even if the Holy See really mastered that kind of technology, it would have something to do with him.
After figuring this out, Sivi left the armored girl behind and walked into the New Testament church with a spirit. The next thing he has to face is Nicholas, one of the most human beings standing on the eastern plains, the current Pope of the Pure White Holy See? Paredes!

Chapter 40 - Dubbing
late at night. 
Qiao Xiu refused the luxury residence provided by Sir Bai Jinghua and returned to the alchemy workshop with Herlan and Hili.
This is not too big alchemy workshop to tell the truth, there are no more than three people, and Qiao Xiu as a man certainly can not let Herlan and Shiri hit the ground.
So I refused Herlan’s proposal to give him the only room, and chose to find a separate workshop to start the daily life of programming day and night.
Entrepreneurship is always hard at the beginning. How many IT industry’s entrepreneurial journeys on the planet started from a small garage?
Whether it was Jobs or Bill Gates, or Page and Brin, they started out in a garage from scratch.
The big billion-dollar companies in Silicon Valley are basically derived from a small garage.
Although the role of the Alchemy workshop in Herlan is not parking, it can be a little bigger than a garage.
On the desktop, Qiao Xiu spread a piece of white paper, a light ball slowly floating on the side of Joe’s body, which dispelled the darkness around him.
This is the lowest level of all the magic ‘lighting’, one of the magic of almost all magical magicians, the original spar that sealed the light has replaced the candle in Nolan, becoming the most common in Nolan. Lighting tools.
Then with the light brought by the light, Qiao Xiu just finished the poster production of “Beauty and Devil”.
At present, Qiao Xiu has not solved how to import images into the program edited with inscriptions in his own consciousness. Therefore, he can only write the title by hand-painting on white paper, and then select the movie when Belle and the devil dance to each other. The scene of the scene is fixed on the white paper.
After completing the production of the poster, Qiao Xiu left the small room and came to the room where the finished product was placed in the alchemy workshop.
The entire room was illuminated by light, and the magical machinery made by Herlan also gave off a glimmer of light, and the inscription of the magical machine projected a portrait of a female magician.
Her pupils were filled with light blue arcane radiance, and her hands rushed with the torrent of magic. The background behind it was heavy rain, and the length of silver and light gold rose with the heavy rain.
Just looking at the portrait of the female magician, I can clearly see how powerful she is.
“Who is she?”
Hiri came out from behind the magical guide. She was holding a piece of white paper on her hand. The white paper was the original manuscript painted by Qiao Xiu.
“Jiana, Jaina Proudmoore.”
Qiao Xiu said her name. This character can be said to be the heroine who runs through the whole story of World of Warcraft. It is also the representative of the game ‘Mage Master’.
“What is her relationship with you…” Hili was a little silent for a while, still couldn’t resist asking Qiao Xiu about this problem.
“relationship?” Qiao Xiu stunned for the first time. Jaina was just a virtual character in the game. Qiao Xiu had no relationship with her, but as a Warcraft player, Qiao Xiu felt that the answer was not correct.
“I think it should be a companion who once fought together.”
Qiao Xiu played World of Warcraft in the league camp, and Jaina was in the same camp. In terms of the game player, Qiao Xiu really counted as a companion who had fought with Jaina.
Hili didn’t talk. She glanced at Jaina’s portrait and suddenly remembered the conversation between Qiao Xiu and Zenas who had occasionally overheard when sleeping in the castle. She remembered that Qiao Xiu once said, ‘I already There are people who like it.’
Qiao Xiu could guess what Heili was thinking, but Qiao Xiu did not deliberately explain it, just looking at the portrait of Jaina.
The paintings projected in the magical machinery were copied by Hiroshi according to the manuscript of Qiao Xiu. The effect of Hili’s painting once again made Qiao Xiu realize… Hili is not suitable as a magician!
Qiao Xiu simply told Hili some techniques of coloring and composition, and let Hiri repaint the magical manuscript according to the manuscript he gave.
In the end, although the result of Shiri’s painting is still a certain distance from ‘professional’, it has at least entered the category of “can use”.
The most important point is that Hili’s paintings have not been influenced by this era. The paintings of this era are mainly oil paintings. The painting style of the paintings is closer to the feeling of the smile of Mona Lisa, and China-National The style of ink painting, this style of painting, Qiao Xiu once saw in the theater of Sir Bai Jinghua, listening to Sir Bai Jinghua said that the painter of this painting comes from a country called ‘Da Xia’.
But both oil painting and ink painting are different from the modern cg style on Earth, but in the paintings of Hilary, Qiao Xiu did not find a feeling of ‘retro’.
“You really haven’t considered a career in painting in the future?”
Qiao Xiu looked up and down the original paintings of Jaina Proudmoore. There are still a few flaws in some small details, but these modifications by Joe Xiu are still acceptable.
If Hilli continues to practice at this pace, Hilli will be a good original game artist.
“I do not know.”
Hili had prepared to correct the proposal of Qiao Xiu, and she helped Joe to paint because Joe Xiu had a life-giving grace for her, but if she wanted to give up the profession of the magician and concentrate on being a painter. Hilli certainly won’t be willing.
After all, the powerful magician in this world is standing at the top of the world, and Hili has enough talent to become a powerful magician.
“I didn’t let you give up your main occupation, just take the painter as a life professional.”
Qiao Xiu gave a perfect answer to Hilli. “Life career.”
Hili took a look at Jaina’s portrait, a seemingly powerful female mage, and suddenly remembered that for Qiao Xiu, it may only be useful for the artist to be a professional. There are too many powerful people around Qiao Xiu. .
“Alright, but one day, ‘My magic will tear you into pieces.’”
Hili quoted Jaina’s line to Qiao Xiu, which was written behind the original Jaina manuscript.
However, Qiao Xiu did not feel any sense of crisis, but listened to Shiri’s words instantly.
“Hey, Hili, this sentence sounds quite sensational, and you are not interested in dubbing the character.”
“With… Dubbing?”
Qiao Xiu once again said a word that touched the blind spot of Hili knowledge, but Hili had already got used to it.
“The character of Jaina has already been set up. Are you interested in becoming the voice of this character?”
“Centrestone Legend” is a game that Joe Xiu is sure to do. A game that only needs original paintings and some animations that are not too difficult can be done. In addition, there is a very troublesome place where the cards are. Dubbing.
Hili had a good voice, and with a little emotion, it perfectly matched the image of Jaina.

Chapter 200 Players descend, Tiandao collapse
The countdown of the forum shows that there is the last hour before the public beta.
I think many players have been there and want to enter the world of Tianchen for the first time.
For Lu Xun, he had to wait ten hours at the rate of 10:1.
"It's still a long way from Qingling city. It's estimated that it's too late for ten hours." he estimated the time.
"Forget it, let's fly first. Just walk and watch all the way. Anyway, the main purpose of today is to see the excitement." Lu Xun smiled and continued to drive the paper crane.
He flew and flew until the last hour before the public test, he stopped in the air.
For the vision of heaven and earth has begun.
The earliest change is the aura around.
At this moment, the aura of the whole Tianchen continent seems not stable as usual, and there is a slight disorder.
This makes many practitioners who are practicing stop practicing.
Psychic disorder is not conducive to cultivation. If you are not careful, you will become possessed.
Many practitioners have dignified expressions, which is definitely a major event related to the whole practice world!
If the psychic power has been disordered, the next cultivation will become extremely difficult.
"What's the matter?"
Small scale Reiki disorder is very common, but now this situation seems not to be the case!
This concerns the future of all practitioners, and no one can fail to take it to heart.
Fortunately, the vision lasted only half an hour.
Half an hour later, the aura of Tianchen continent returned to the previous stable state, and there was no difference.
However, strange things happened in the sky of Tianchen continent!
Translucent ripples spread in the sky from time to time, and there will be swirling distortions in several places.
Many practitioners flying in the air suddenly feel that they are under great pressure, just like the weight on their body. Under the heavy load, they stop flying and choose to land.
Lu Xun was the same. He controlled the paper crane, fell steadily, and then looked up at the sky.
The player's vision before his arrival is naturally impossible to see in his previous life.
Now, he is looking at all this with the mentality of watching the excitement, and he just feels that ™️ It's spectacular!
"Compared with the inexplicable large-scale arrival of foreign nationalities, the signs before the arrival of players still have a lot of cards!" Lu Xun thought in his heart.
As time went by, the visions in the sky continued to maintain and became more and more serious.
Finally, the sky broke!
A big hole suddenly broke in the sky!
The whole Tianchen continent, as long as you look up, you can see the big black hole in the air!
Lu Xun knows very well that the most terrible heaven and earth vision in the Tianchen continent is about to begin!
——The way of heaven collapsed!
In the dark cave, lightning slowly produced, roared and bright.
All this continued, and at the last minute before the player came, there was a burst of dazzling light in the big black hole!
"Hiss!" Lu Xun immediately lowered his head, closed his eyes and stopped looking directly at him.
Not only him, but almost everyone in the whole Tianchen continent is doing similar actions.
The main peak of the demon sect, Shen Yan and several peak masters are getting together and looking at the big hole in the sky with a dignified face.
When the light shines in the world, these overhaul walkers in the seventh and eighth territories can't open their eyes one after another!
The power of heaven and earth cannot be resisted even by overhaul walkers.
Even Shen Yan and others are like this, not to mention the disciples of the demon sect.
Ji Li was also looking up at the sky and thought, "I don't know if Lu Xun can see such a grand occasion in other places?"
When the light came, she immediately lowered her head and closed her eyes. She only felt that her eyes were tingling.
At the back mountain of the demon sect, even the second elder martial sister sitting on the boulder and the Third Elder martial brother Zhuge Laifu looking out by the kitchen window chose to close their eyes.
God is irreversible!
Only at the top of Houshan mountain, a man in a white shirt, like a middle-aged scholar, was always looking up at the sky.
Under such visions, he was still in the mood to drink a mouthful of hot tea.
The gentleman took a sip of tea.
He looked straight at the sky and saw the scene of the collapse of the way of heaven, but narrowed his eyes slightly.
Time: 3999 years of Tianchen calendar.
Public beta countdown.
Ten, Nine, eight... Three, two, one!
Lu Xun, who closed his eyes tightly, opened his eyes.
The previous dazzling light has completely dissipated, and the huge black hole in the sky has disappeared, as if nothing had happened.
The world of practitioners was shocked by this. Later, I didn't know who took the head. Today's scene was named "the collapse of heaven".
From today on, in the eyes of people in Tianchen continent, many people in the world... Have changed!
A group of people in this world have become different from us!
Such people are called aliens.
I don't know why. No one doubts that they come from another world. They just think that they have become different because of the collapse of the way of heaven.
It seems that there is an invisible hand that controls something.
It sets such an alien identity for the player, not an alien.
When Lu Xun first crossed, he thought that this seemed to be a real world. But at the moment, everything seems to be a game here.
Maybe... Is it a combination of the two?
He can't figure it out yet.
At the moment, in front of Lu Xun, there are one prompt message after another.
"[Ding! Open beta starts!]"
"[welcome to Tianchen version 1.0 - Tiandao collapse!]"
Lu Xun closed the prompt in front of him, opened the master-student interface and looked at it. In the column of registered disciples, his sword boy Mo Guanji and Han Bagui have been displayed online!
At this moment, players have come all over the Tianchen continent!
"Times have changed," Lu Xun whispered.
Everywhere in Tianchen mainland, except for a few lucky players who have participated in the internal test, most players are in contact with the world for the first time.
They looked left and right curiously, and someone would jump a few times from time to time.
Some people are touching the flowers and trees around, some are touching their face and body, and some are even studying where to take off their clothes
"How real!" this is the first thought of most players.
"I blew the game! Is it too realistic?"
"Yes! I feel like I'm not a player, but a jumper!"
"Other game companies can go bankrupt. What do you compare with Tianchen?"
Thousands of words converge into one sentence - "this game is awesome!"
A few minutes later, some sand carving players were still addicted to some strange things, while others began to take action.
Many players who are used to watching the forum think:
"I don't know if I have a chance to witness the style of the legendary purple hall?"

Chapter 100 Tiantian was injured
In front of so many people, was questioned by a pupil that he did not have common sense, summer suddenly red eyes, can not help but stretch out his hand to push her.
"Ah!"
I don't know who threw an empty water bottle on the ground behind her. Ning Tiantian's backward foot just stepped on the slippery water bottle, and her limbs immediately looked like rowing, and the back of her head was about to hit the ground.
The people around were all stunned and forgot to respond.
Ning Tiantian is most afraid of pain. When she thinks of the appearance of her head blooming, she immediately closes her frightened eyes. But after a long time, the imaginary pain does not appear, but there is some pain in the toe, but the head is soft and soft.
She can't help but open her eyes and see Li Yanmo's eyebrows frown painfully.
It turns out that between the electric light and flint, Li Yanmo automatically falls to the ground, and serves as a human cushion for her, so that she will not land on the back of her head.
"Brother ink, are you ok?" Ning Tiantian didn't take care of her foot pain. She immediately got up from him and touched his chest nervously for fear that she would crush his bones.
Li Yan Mo Mou color is deeper, immediately grasped her disorderly ignition small hand to get up from the ground, the voice is a little hoarse, "I'm ok."
Ning Tiantian this just relaxed a breath, then ferocious stare at the culprit, "Summer, what do you mean by this, bully me small, right?"
"I, no, no..." Summer immediately pear with rain, she just want to push her away, did not expect to push her to the ground.
"Don't you even say you're sorry?" Li Yanmo's cold voice sounded on one side.
Summer face more embarrassed, was like the boy so roar, her bottom of the grievance is not good, but still to sweet low head, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to."
Ning Tiantian didn't say that she didn't forgive her, so she pulled away her words and said, "brother ink, the high jump has started. Let's go quickly."
"Primary school high jumpers, please go to playground No.3 for preparation." a prompt came from the loudspeaker.
The high jump in the primary school is a leap over high jump, which is the simplest one in the high jump. Before the high jump, we still need to do some basic warm-up exercises.
This time, Ning Tiantian stood on the red and white runway, and Li Yanmo stood by and looked at her.
"Brother ink, cheer me on Ning Tiantian side doing warm-up exercise, while cheerfully yelled at him.
Li Yanmo nods gently.
"Tiantian, we're here. Let's go!" Just after other events, Su Yi and cookie also came to see her race.
Ning Tiantian is full of confidence. The height of the high jump bar is up to her shoulder. If she adds strength, it should be easy to jump over. Anyway, she doesn't want to be ranked.
But there is always a gap between the ideal and the reality. Just as she was about to cross the high jump bar, she had some painful feet before. Suddenly, because her leg lifting movement became like a needle prick, her body couldn't help shaking in the air.
Did she hurt her foot by summer?
People all have the instinct of seeking harm and avoiding profit. Ning Tiantian immediately wants to take back the leg that just stepped out of the high jump bar, but it's too late!
When Li Yanmo found that Tiantian look some wrong, the thrilling scene appeared in his pupil.
The next second, Ning Tiantian even fell on the ground with a pole, and still fell on the plastic playground without sponge cushion. It seemed that the sound of bone breaking could be heard.
"Tiantian!" He trembled and growled, but no matter how hard he ran, he couldn't stop Tiantian from falling to the ground.
"It hurts so much!" At that moment, the whole playground seemed to have lost its voice, leaving only the cry of Ning Tiantian tearing heart and lung.

Chapter 75 - Honey, you have to get used to 1
The celebration banquet of the small team was of course not finished, because an emperor was killed halfway through.
When this person leaned on the car door to smoke, Wang Tingting and others automatically chose to quit and offered Ye Yunxi both hands.
“Yunxi, come on!”
“Seize the opportunity!”
What opportunity to seize? Yeyunxi was confused and couldn’t understand it at all!
The corners of Dijunxie’s mouth were curved like a smile, and he successfully made a group of girls on the roadside blush and heartbeat.
“I think I have the right to eat with friends.” Ye Yunxi decided to fight for his rights in this matter.
“I don’t think you understand the meaning of the contract.” The man drove drastically, and the influx of wind disturbed his dark and broken hair, and blurred the long and deep eyes.
“The fiancee means that you should be better than me first than others.”
This is also true. Ye Yunxi rubbed her chin and recalled the little lovers she had seen before. The gluey state made her subconsciously fight a cold war.
Forget it, now there is no need to do the glue-like step.
“Where to go?” What are you going to take her to learn this time?
“Verify your learning results.”
verification? How to verify? When in doubt, the car stopped in front of a restaurant in an upscale neighborhood.
This restaurant has a very high style. In addition to expensive meals and only accepting wealthy people, there is also a rule that people who enter and leave here must wear formal attire!
In other words, Ye Yunxi’s sportswear and sneakers don’t even want to go in now. “Here? Are you sure?” Are she sure she can get in?
“come!” He hooked the thin waist and hugged the person into his arms. The soft touch made Di Junxie very satisfied. Sure enough, it feels good as seen during the exercise. He hooked his mouth subconsciously and looked down at the person in his arms.
Ye Yunxi was also looking at him, her beautiful eyebrows were obviously a little unpleasant because of him, such a close distance even crossed her line of defense, the smell of tobacco mixed with unfamiliar smell made her somewhat uneasy.
“Honey, you have to get used to it.” Di Junxie leaned close to her ear and whispered softly.
There are many men in the army, but everyone is a buddy, and no one has ever talked to her next to her!
Ye Yunxi’s face turned red, and he glared at Di Junxie.
Of course, the man laughed instead of anger, and with a long arm, he held him tighter. “This is the most basic contact between lovers.”
I know! No need to say this over and over again! The beautiful eyebrows were slightly furrowed, Ye Yunxi was also unambiguous, and he tucked off his long hair and knocked out Di Junxie’s hands neatly, changed to a posture of arms, and smiled slightly: “I like this better.”
“Alright.” Di Junxie withdrew his gaze, and when he raised his eyes, the whole person’s momentum also changed, from charming to domineering and majestic!
This man is really handsome!
“Buy you a formal suit first.” The clothing store is right next to him. As soon as Di Junxie walks in, he is surrounded by waiters. These people are used to seeing the elites of the upper class, and they can tell the status of Di Junxie at a glance, but Ye Yunxi… Sportswear and sneakers?Is it another Pan Gaozhi?
“A formal suit.” Di Junxie threw out a word indifferently, and instantly Ye Yunxi had a few more clothes in front of him.
The waiters were courteous, and Ye Yunxi could only change one set at a time. However, no matter what clothes she wears, they look good on her. Slim waist and hips, of course, everything is beautiful to wear.
Chapter 76 - Honey, you have to get used to 2
Yeyunxi couldn’t see the difference. Anyway, they are all skirts. The only difference is the color and length. Is there any difference in the rest? ?
“Miss, which one you wear looks good, it’s really hard to choose!”
“Yeah, yeah, it’s super difficult to choose, otherwise you can buy it all!”
Buy all? Is there a mistake? Just have a meal, thought it was a catwalk show?
Seeing that the waiters couldn’t make up their minds, Di Junxie got up, picked a dark starry sky dress from a pile of clothes and handed it over. “this.”
“this?” Ye Yunxi took it and glanced at it, except for something more shining, isn’t it a skirt?
But she can only switch on and walk out of the locker room.
At that moment, even the waiter didn’t know what to say.
This dress is really suitable for Yeyunxi! It’s like tailor-made for her!
The background color is as deep as the sea, blue from top to bottom becomes lighter, and the skirt is like a shallow beach. The long skirt is covered with a layer of tulle, and the fragments on the surface are as bright as stars. Walking around, the stars flicker, beautiful!
“What a nice view!”
“Like a sea spirit at night!”
“It feels mysterious and beautiful!”
Although I am disdainful of the profession of love, beauty is beauty.
Everyone is very satisfied with this skirt, but Dijunxie glanced at it, then frowned: “Take it off.”
“why?” Yeyunxi is very curious, everyone said, is it good?
Di Junxie’s face was even more ugly.
It looks good, but the breast-length dress is too revealing, so pull it down a little bit, so what is the difference with no shirt? And the back, showing so much, who do you want to seduce? and so! ! “Change this one!”
Di Junxie had an ugly face and handed over another skirt, and Ye Yunxi changed it silently.
This time, the long skirt is rarely in the middle of the standard. The design of the small stand-up collar even wraps up the neck. Di Junxie nodded in satisfaction: “That’s it.”
This one? The waiters all said that they didn’t look as good as the starry sky model. But the money masters have said so, they can only collect the money openly. However, it was Pan Gaozhi’s little love in their eyes that passed the card.
“Swipe.”
“what?”The waiter looked at Di Junxie, the man’s card had been drawn out, but Ye Yunxi said directly: “I can still afford a skirt.”
Dijunxie glanced at her for unknown reasons, but did not say anything, and put away the card.
The waiter’s head is about to explode. Can you buy it?
The cheapest skirts here are tens of thousands. Those who can afford it are the rich, right?
So this sister paper is not Pan Gaozhi’s love, people, people themselves are Gaozhi? ?
At that moment, the waiter couldn’t help but stand in awe. After all, it was not too much for those who were in their business to meet a woman who paid for the clothes here.
It turns out that the little sister is a rich man herself! good job!
After changing her skirt and getting her hairstyle a little bit, Ye Yunxi followed Di Junxie and walked into the restaurant.
The advantage of being young is that there is no need for makeup, and the skin has a texture that can be broken by blowing. The red lips and white skin are just right, such as a ripe apple, which is delicate and beautiful.
“Hello sir, how many?” The waiter greeted him eagerly, but Di Junxie turned around, took Ye Yunxi’s hand, and stubbornly wrapped it around his arm.
“You have to get used to it.” The man whispered charmingly. Be Di Junxie’s woman.
Chapter 77 - Honey, you have to get used to 3
Okay, just get used to it. Anyway, when the time comes to see the parents, it is natural that you will not show your feet. Ye Yunxi calmly hooked the man’s arm and sat down.
There are a lot of people in the restaurant, and even for such expensive meals, diners are constantly coming. Many people looked over subconsciously, and a small part of them knew Di Junxie. The circle of the upper class is so big, and the heirs of the emperor’s family are so powerful that they will never forget them once they have been seen.
“That seems to be an emperor, right?”
“Who is the woman opposite? Is there a lady like this in several big families?”
“It’s pretty, and it’s a good match with the emperor.”
“Cut, it’s just a meal, can it prove that it must be the girlfriend of the Emperor Young Master?”
“Yes, is that woman worthy of God?”
The man’s gaze fell on Ye Yunxi, full of surprise, while the woman’s gaze fell on Ye Yunxi, full of disdain.
“Well, there is no such person among the young ladies of the big families. Maybe it’s just to cling to a high position and deliberately come to eat a meal, poor ghost? Does she understand the etiquette?!”
etiquette? Sorry, sister really understands! Lifting his head and glanced around, Ye Yunxi hooked the corner of his mouth and picked up the knife and fork gracefully. Posture, full marks! Temperament, also full marks!
She doesn’t know the etiquette of the upper class, and she doesn’t care if she is worthy of God Junxie, but no one can despise her Yeyunxi. Because you will, she will also Yeyunxi, even if she doesn’t, she can learn as much as she grows her mind! The petite woman evoked an arrogant smile, her dark eyes swept across the jealous faces, gracefully and calmly swallowing the beef, her posture was so beautiful that she couldn’t look away.
“Is that really the eldest lady of which family?”
“Simply perfect!”
“Excuse me, this gentleman ordered a song “Canon” for the lady, please enjoy it.” When the waiter with the violin came to the table, there was a gasp.
Young master di had ordered a violin song for this woman, and it was Canon! It’s so jealous!
“it is good.” Ye Yunxi smiled and glanced at Di Junxie. What is this? It’s just a contract, is it really going to be a full set? ?
However, Di Junxie put down his knife and fork, so he took his time, waiting for the music to start. Whether it is a contract or not, this is what he wants to do for Ye Yunxi.
The sound of the violin is melodious, matching the dim atmosphere of the restaurant, romantic and charming.
If the girl sitting here is any girl, I’m afraid it would have already fallen, but Ye Yunxi rubbed his temples. She felt that being a woman of Di Junxie must be very tired, because this woman must be almighty. Including, know how to appreciate music! !
When the violin was over, a large bouquet of red roses came up immediately, and Ye Yunxi’s mouth was cramping with laughter. What exactly is this going to do? ! Instinct told her that there must be a conspiracy!
“Why isn’t the rose for me!!!”
“Sao Emperor, who is so cold, would even give roses to others?!”
“I heard that the emperor’s father is forcing the emperor to fix his fiancée.”
“So, this is what I meant?”
“Interesting, it seems that they are not members of the top clan. Does the emperor miss his eyes and will not be used by the wild cats?”
use? Please, it is him now, just admiring Yeyunxi unilaterally. But not necessarily after three years.
“I will send you back.”
The hot rose, the charming girl, more eye-catching than this is the man’s cold aura that is so cold that he can’t eat the fireworks. In an instant, everyone couldn't look away, and they feel that they were a perfect match!

Chapter 1910: Not bothering to steal the limelight
Young Master Hai’s clone seemed to be actively trying to find Song Shuhang in the hope of breaking the karma between them using a clone.
If Song Shuhang had not entered a dreamland of Young Master Hai’s life, he might have really been fooled. Song Shuhang had long since been convinced of Young Master Hai’s ability in scheming and planning. If it were not for his bad luck, perhaps Young Master Hai would have long succeeded and caused his death.
Song Shuhang said happily, [But since Young Master Hai himself is going to deliver a clone to my doorstep, I have no reason not to pick it up!]
The clone was definitely quite valuable, and with it coming his way, it really was no different from a big gift package.
While he was in thought, Song Shuhang withdrew from the “dreamland” state.
With that, the dreamland ended.
He slowly opened his eyes, and found himself lying on a big bed inside a room with his shoes still on…
Song Shuhang raised his head and took a look outside the window. As he looked past the window, he saw that the sky was already getting brighter, and a new day had begun.
He took out his phone, and looked at the date. 7:00 a.m. Tuesday. November 19, 2019.
“It feels like I slept for quite a while this time. Senior White’s hypnotic smoke bomb effect is really no joke.” Song Shuhang climbed out of the bed, and reached out to open his Inner World.
Sixteen stepped out of his Inner World. After her seclusion, her skin had become as snowy as a boiled egg with its shell peeled off.
“Good morning, Shuhang.” Sixteen stretched her body, and said, “Why didn’t you respond yesterday?”
When she was done with her seclusion last night, she wanted to leave the Inner World but found that Song Shuhang was not responding to her. Senior Turtle and Lady Onion were attracted by the noise, so they accompanied her all this time.
Song Shuhang stretched out his finger, and poked her face lightly.
“…” Su Clan’s Sixteen.
“Hehe.” Song Shuhang chuckled. Su Clan’s Sixteen’s skin felt great, and poking her had brought him a great sense of satisfaction. “Ahem, anyway, I accidentally got hit by Senior White’s new invention last night, and I ended up sleeping until now.”
Sixteen said, “No wonder.”
Behind him, Senior Turtle and Lady Onion also emerged from the Inner World.
Sixteen asked, “Are we heading to the scholarly faction today?”
“Mm-hm, I’ll make an appointment with Senior Eternal Fire in a bit.” Song Shuhang nodded and said, “By the way, have you seen the gemstone fruits in the Inner World? You should try some, they taste great. When you eat them, just remember to put the fruit pips aside. They can still be used.”
“The Inner World Assistant brought us a batch, and we all got to taste a few.” Lady Onion giggled. “After eating, I feel that my strength has improved a little.”
“It’s great that you enjoyed it. Sixteen, you can bring a few back with you and let Senior Seven have a taste as well,” Song Shuhang said.
At the same time, his consciousness swept across the floor as he prepared to contact Senior Eternal Fire.
Song Shuhang said curiously, “Eh? Senior White’s clone and Senior Eternal Fire aren’t here?”
Where did the two seniors go?
Lady Onion suggested, “Maybe they went out for breakfast?”
“I’ll call them and ask.” Sixteen took out her phone and called True Monarch Eternal Fire—she was not sure if Senior White’s clone had his phone on him, so she decided to contact True Monarch Eternal Fire instead.
The call quickly connected.
Su Clan’s Sixteen said, “Good morning, Senior Eternal Fire, where are you and Senior White?”
“Fellow Daoist White made a mistake, and sent us both to Mars,” True Monarch Eternal Fire replied in a helpless tone.
“There is still a signal on Mars? Is this a new version of the magic-modified phone?” Song Shuhang asked while leaning over to Sixteen’s phone.
True Monarch Eternal Fire replied, “No, we’re currently in Fellow Daoist White’s secret base on Mars. There’s only a signal in the specified part of the base. We should be returning to Earth at noon. Fellow Daoist White is just carrying out some experiments.”
Sixteen replied, “Okay, Senior. See you at noon, then.”
“Just what kind of mistake did Senior White make that caused him and True Monarch Eternal Fire to be sent to Mars?” Song Shuhang did not know whether to laugh or cry at the peculiar event.
Sixteen put away her phone. “What should we do until then?”
Song Shuhang pinched his chin. “Hm, let’s go and find Young Master Hai while we still have time.”
Senior Turtle asked, “Young Master Hai? Who’s that?”
Lady Onion explained, “He’s Song Shuhang’s mortal enemy, and he should be at the Fifth Stage Spiritual Emperor Realm.”
Senior Turtle rolled its eyes.
Song Shuhang said, “It’s the demonic cultivator who received Demon Emperor Hezhi’s inheritance. His strategic ability is amazing, but his luck is not very good.”
Senior Scarlet Heaven Sword said, “You’re really going to go and bully that demonic cultivator, eh?”
Song Shuhang responded, “I have a hunch that he’ll be giving me a surprise.” Song Shuhang might just be able to get the inner demon tribulation he’d been looking for through Young Master Hai’s body.
Su Clan’s Sixteen asked, “Shuhang, do you know where Young Master Hai is?”
Song Shuhang said, “Hehe, I got to dream of his life yesterday when I was sleeping, so I got some information.”
Sixteen nodded, and said, “Then let’s go and find him. It’s seven o’clock now, we have to hurry up. Senior White and Senior Eternal Fire will probably be back by 11 or 12 o’clock.”
“I’ll pack some things before we leave.” Song Shuhang opened the storage box in the room, and then placed one gemstone fruit, a portion of stone milk from the Black Dragon World, and 10 Saber Intent Condensing Lotus Seeds inside.
“Huh? Why are you leaving these things inside the storage box? Why don’t you just let me eat them instead?” Lady Onion asked.
“These are reserved for Little Cai.” Song Shuhang flicked Lady Onion’s onion tip.
He then sent a text to Little Cai, telling her that he had left her a treasure in Medicine Master’s building, and that she should come over.
Little Cai had been secretly protecting his parents, keeping watch on them and seeing if there were any malicious fellow daoists who tried to approach them. So far, no abnormalities had occurred.
When everything was prepared, Song Shuhang picked up the shrunken Senior Turtle, stuffed Lady Onion into his pocket, and left Medicine Master’s building with Sixteen.
As soon as he stepped out of the house, Song Shuhang saw a couple who looked like students not far from Medicine Master’s building; they seemed to be arguing.
The man said seriously, “Little Zi, you have to believe me. That other woman and I were just acting out a scene. The only person I love is you.”
Ptui, it was actually a love affair.
Also, which TV show was that line from? Song Shuhang almost thought the virtuous lamia had come out to snatch someone’s lines.
Sixteen suddenly said, “Hm… I beat this guy up before. He changed his hairstyle, and I almost didn’t recognize him.”
Song Shuhang smiled lightly, recalling his first meeting with Sixteen.
At this moment, the man happened to see Sixteen beside Song Shuhang, and his expression changed slightly. He then immediately said to his girlfriend in a serious tone, “I only have you in my heart. Believe me. I will never let you down. If there are other women in my heart, may the heavens strike me down with five bolts of lightning!”
“That guy is lying,” said the master of psychology, Senior Turtle.
Song Shuhang asked, “Then, should we cooperate with him?”
He rubbed his fingers lightly, and used the Lightning Drawing Technique of the Lightning Chapter of the Heavenly Master’s Righteous Techniques, and summoned a single lightning bolt.
Boom~
Lightning suddenly struck down from the skies.
Song Shuhang took this opportunity to hold Sixteen’s little hand, and walked away, not bothering to steal the limelight.

Chapter 99: Kill no matter what! (Part 1)
Although he had high resistance, he would die from being hit by a bullet!
And now, with the existence of modern weapons, no metahuman below Class C could take on such weapons.
Which was why Lu Shu felt that these three criminals were dumb for continuing to fight even though they did cause much damage previously.
Even if you want to be unruly, at least wait till you are Class C!
Luo Cheng was adequately prepared towards dealing with these three metahumans, adequate enough to surprise Lu Shu. Two class D men from the heavenly network leading their own teams, and 14 Class Es responsible for the traffic to and fro the South. Additionally, there were numerous policemen supporting the entire operation, they must have classified this issue as one of extremely high priority.
As for the two black coats on the bridge, Lu Shu thought of an explanation as well. Even though the Heavenly Network was adequately prepared, deploying their men early on, they did not have awakened metahumans to train with them for battle experience.
Take Liang Che’s treatment as an example. After giving him a tranquilizer, they brought him back and did not have to put up much of a fight.
With such good control of situations, the people of the Heavenly Network never had much experience with battle, which meant they would make mistakes when they really had to fight.
This was extremely normal.
What if highly experienced team popped up to control awakened metahumans as well as practitioners right at the dawn of the era of rich magical energy? Who would have trained with this team?
There was a saying when units faced a battle in reality- only after weathering a series of battles and hardships would seasoned veterans surface.
But the world was still peaceful now.
Perhaps there were also highly skilled veterans employed by the heavenly network. But compared to their entire organization, there was only a very small number of such individuals.
Lu Shu didn’t guess wrong. The seasoned warriors who really went through battles had already been subject to employment from different organizations. Everyone understood the value of all these experienced men.
At this juncture, the personnel from the Heavenly Network had caught up. Lu Shu tried to conceal himself more, preparing to use his celestial cloak as an escape technique.
That strength-based metahuman was carrying his two comrades, hiding behind some walls in fear and not even revealing his head in fear of snipers. One shot could take his life.
But he couldn’t sit idly either. If he was surrounded by the impending practitioners, it would be impossible for him to escape. It was imperative to know that there were two class D practitioners in that group!
At that instant, this metahuman made an important decision. He exposed the heads of his two comrades, using them as a shield to protect himself as he bolted towards the southwest, as there were many infrastructures there and he could sneak an escape if he made it there.
His two accomplices were in shock and anger. Never did they think that their friend, who earlier swore to go through thick and thin together, would betray them while they were still alive!
Their shouts and curses echoed through the night, just like wailing hungry wolves awaiting impending death.
Everyone was stunned. Even those people who were chasing after these metahumans. They had never faced such a cold-blooded person.
This metahuman… What was he like before awakening? A murderer? A habitual offender?
This scene reminded people of the brutal murderers in news reports, extremely cold-blooded and heartless.
Lu Shu was in even more shock! This guy was heading towards Lu Shu’s hiding spot! Damn it! Lu Shu frantically retreated but having only taken a few steps, that metahuman had already bashed into this small alley!
By now, one of his comrades had already lost his life while the other was struggling for his life, panting and bleeding profusely.
Just when Lu Shu could not be more shocked, that metahuman brutally snapped the neck of his comrade who was still alive seconds ago.
Did he do this to prevent his comrade from taking revenge in future?
Lu Shu suddenly realized that he had underestimated the brutality and possibilities of this evolving world. The impending violence and chaos left Lu Shu extremely unsettled.
If only those people in online forums who argued that the metahumans caused no harm saw this scene… Their perspective would probably take a hundred and eighty-degree turn immediately!
Gaining supernatural abilities within a short span of time, who knew what would happen!
Lu Shu continued to retreat along the alley. He did not want to get embroiled in this mess and had only come to see the situation. He had thought it would be quite a suitable scenario for Lu Xiaoyu to collect some souls after the battle.
The metahuman was dashing frantically towards the small alley with the people from the heavenly network hot on his heels, in a formation planning to surround him.
Everyone who saw the motionless bodies of the other two criminals all had a line of thought. They all knew how cold and brutal their opponent was.
“Kill no matter what,” A class D practitioner said calmly. His sword glowed with a bright green light. He bit into his tongue and spat out a glob of blood, “GO!”
As the blood landed on the sword, the sword flew towards the criminal like a shooting star. This practitioner stayed rooted at the spot for a moment, there was an evident cost for using that technique. But he had no choice now, he had to use his special technique to prevent the criminal from getting away.
They might be practitioners, but before cultivating their skills, they were educated to protect the country. They were affectionately known as soldiers by the people and now that these three criminals had committed such a crime, they could not allow them to get away under their watch, for they would be the shame of the people!
This move was far from his comfort zone. It was a last-ditch move in the heavenly network which might cost his life. Even if he did not suffer any injuries from it, using this move would cause his skills to deteriorate greatly and his vitality foundations would be damaged, making it hard for him to improve in future.
This was to sacrifice his future for a technique!
The blade soared relentlessly towards the escaping criminal. The green shooting star glowed with vivace, lighting up everything along its way, including the fear in the criminal’s eyes when he turned around to see the sword.
Most bullets could travel faster than sound. But it was difficult to see the bullet break the speed barrier, as everything happened within the chambers of the gun.
As the bullet flies under pressure, it will slow down to below the speed of sound. The surroundings of the bullet will emit great sound as it travels.
And at this moment, the green shooting star sliced through the air, with white smoke trailing it! This sword was not as fast as a bullet, but its power was immense!
Class D metahumans were described to be able to evade high-tech weapons not because they were faster than bullets, but only because they were too fast for the operators of these weapons to lock their aim and get a good shot!
Chapter 100: Class C Practitioner! (Part 2)
The green shooting star arrived in front of the criminal in an instant. The criminal only had enough time to prevent the sword from striking his vitals as it struck him heavily.
But the Class D metahuman’s physique was indeed strong. Although the sword pierced into his left upper chest, it could not go through it completely as it remained stuck in his body.
The metahuman was carried by the momentum of the sword and he crashed into a wall behind him, smashing the wall in the process! His physique far exceeded the normal human’s as he was still alive even after being struck by such a powerful sword. He was still alive and struggling to get up to continue with his escape!
Just then, behind the fallen wall, Lu Shu was exposed in his celestial cloak…
“If I say I was out for a walk, you guys probably wouldn’t believe it, would you…”
Everyone was rather confused. Why was there a person behind this fallen wall? This guy with celestial strength and aura was obviously a metahuman, who would believe he was just passing by?
Suspicion aroused. The criminal was sandwiched in between Lu Shu and the practitioners of the heavenly network which were, at this point in time, closing in.
The criminal let out a roar and wanted to escape from Lu Shu’s direction. He had nothing much to consider. He would decimate everything in his way, or he will be the one who will be decimated.
Lu Shu was standing in an extremely bad position. Even if he expressed that he wouldn’t retaliate, the escaping criminal might worry that he would attack him from the back after he passed by.
The escaping criminal had only one choice. KILL!
His body started glowing, and a powerful aura was exuded from him.
“This is bad, he’s awakening!”
“Kill on the spot!”
“Seize that suspicious guy!”
The criminal had already bolted towards Lu Shu, with a fist aimed towards him. Who would have thought that this guy will exude the awakening glow again after having awakened three times?!
If he really awakened, no one knew what would happen. Class C strength based metahuman? What would that be like?
At least they could confirm that the person behind this wall wasn’t an accomplice. But in any case, such a suspicious person appearing here had to be brought back!
The strength of the criminal was rapidly increasing. The injuries on his body started healing, and the sword in his body remained still like an extension of his body, with the bleeding stopping completely.
The men of the heavenly network were confused as such a sight greeted them. Strength typed metahumans always seemed like they could use brute force to overcome anything!
The guy over there… he could possibly die?! At least amongst them, no one dared to claim that they could withstand such a heavy punch!
From the moment the criminal made his move, Lu Shu moved his left foot back half a step to gain a stable footing. He then raised an arm to counter the impending blow!
The world was a tough place to be in.
Even after training, Lu Shu never expected himself to be in battle under such a murderous predicament. All he ever thought of even if he became strong was where to go and have fun with Lu Xiaoyu.
But he had no other choice now.
Just like his struggle since leaving the orphanage, just like him selling boiled eggs in a small pot, Lu Shu’s life always seemed like he didn’t have much of a choice.
But his heart always had one mantle. To live on.
To live on wholeheartedly!
He wasn’t an arrogant person. But since he had chosen to come, he had to try his best to resist!
Momentarily, his legs resonated with the earth. His waist resonated with his legs. His arms resonated with his waist. And his strength resonated with his arms!
This blow from Lu Shu met with the one from the criminal. With a loud ‘Ka’, the violent criminal’s arm gave way.
The criminal, who was stronger than Lu Shu, actually lost to Lu Shu’s blow!
This was the technique Li Xianyi imparted to Lu Shu. This was the primary ability and reflex Lu Shu trained hard every day for!
From this moment on, even though Lu Shu was a Class E in terms of his celestial map cultivation, his body’s physique and strength had already tread onto that of a class D’s! And although the criminal had symptoms of a Class C, he had only recently awakened into a Class D!
One of them had proper technique, the other not. The results were evident immediately!
At the same time, corpsedog emerged from Lu Shu. It sped towards the Heavenly Network with its jade structure shining in the night sky. It wasn’t a bright light, but a crimson and bloody shine!
The sword did not have any malicious intent. It only drew a large circle to prevent the metahumans from advancing upon Lu Shu. After that, it returned to Lu Shu’s celestial map. Lu Shu kicked the criminal towards the group of men from the heavenly network and disappeared into the alley.
Everyone was stunned as the criminal struggled to even get up, seemingly plotting another escape. His original awakening glow had disappeared, probably from the beating he received.
That scene of the flying sword was etched vividly in the men of the heavenly network.
Suddenly someone thought, it would have been easy for that flying sword to take this criminal’s life. But that guy merely used it to prevent our advancement. Perhaps he was planning to leave right from the start!
There was another Class D practitioner in their midst. He also had a last-ditch technique which he did not execute… Not because he did not have the time to, but he did not want to as he did not want to risk his future by using that move which could damage his vitals.
He could not help but think. That guy manipulated his sword with such ease and he looked nothing like him or his colleagues, who had to put their life on the line to use such a skill. Could he be a Class C practitioner?
Even if he really spent all his energy, could he stop that guy from leaving? That move required him to use all his energy, while that guy had already mastered it with such ease! This was probably the difference between class D and class C!
The criminal eventually died. That green sword which impaled him had taken half his life. Everything that happened after, including his awakening glow, was a cause of his desire to live on. When his awakening failed, it explained that he could not resist the immense blow dealt to him.
The battle had ended. The three criminals were dead. But this night had given everyone much to ponder over.
And that sudden appearance and disappearance of that person were etched deep in everyone’s minds.
When did a Class C appear in Luo Cheng?!

Chapter 271: You Were Never Alone, You Still Have Me (1)
“At the time, you had returned from playing ball with a group of us. In front of so many people, she didn’t flinch at all. She said so much; she even planned out how your future would be together. It sounded quite nice, and you both looked like a nice match. Truth be told, at the time, I was a little interested in her. You know… This fair lady deserved a proper man. But at the time, I felt like the two of you were quite the match, so I really liked the idea of you two together. Thinking back on it, many people had the same thought. But that day, even after she said so much, you simply replied sorry.”
“The most beautiful girl in school asked why you rejected her. What did you say back then?”
Han Zhifan tilted his head and carefully thought about it for some time before saying, “…After so many years, I still clearly remember what you said – that a person was probably only single because there was someone who was impossible to be with or someone who would never look back.”
At the time, he thought He Jichen was just spouting nonsense to get rid of the girl.
That day, He Jichen went back to the dorm and stayed there quietly for a long time. He didn’t say anything until the next day.
Up until now, he figured He Jichen was in a bad mood then because someone confessed to him, but he now realized that He Jichen was in a bad mood because those words stabbed his heart.
At that thought, Han Zhifan added, “…What about her? The supporting actress who left you all alone for so many years. Deep down inside, was she that someone who was impossible to be with or was she that someone who would never look back?”
He Jichen stared at the liquid through the crystal clear glass with a dull expression on his face for a long time. Then he looked up at Han Zhifan and said, “Someone who’s impossible to be with.”
As He Jichen said this, he looked down with infinite sorrow in his eyes. When he spoke again, his voice was soft with a hidden, immense sorrow. “But in any case, there’s a possibility. As long as it’s her, I would turn back with no hesitation, but she’s never given me the slightest chance…”
After a pause, He Jichen said, “…and she’s never thought about giving me a chance.”
The atmosphere in the room instantly turned a little somber.
The two of them stayed silently like that for a long time until they’d almost finished drinking their glasses. Then Han Zhifan cleared his throat and changed the subject to something more interesting: “Oh, right! Today, the woman who helped take care of the supporting actress’s wound and your wound… is she the on-call doctor for the production cast and crew?”
“No, that was the screenwriter, Cheng Weiwan.”
“Cheng Weiwan is the writer of “Three Thousand Lunatics”? She’s so young! That can’t be right… wasn’t she a writer? How does she know about medicine?”
“Oh, her dad is Cheng Weiguo.”
Cheng Weiguo? Han Zhifan’s fingers suddenly gripped the tall glass hard. His voice sounded a little excited. “Cheng Weiguo? You’re telling me that her dad is the world-famous doctor, Cheng Weiguo?”
He Jichen nodded gently and swiftly replied with one word, “Yeah.”
Chapter 272: You Were Never Alone, You Still Have Me (2)
Translator: Paperplane Editor: Caron_ As He Jichen finished what he said, Han Zhifan suddenly slammed his tall glass onto the coffee table.
He Jichen furrowed his brows and turned to look over at Han Zhifan in confusion. “What’s wrong?”
Han Zhifan didn’t say anything, but his gaze upon the tall glass grew intense.
Cheng Weiguo… Even if he turned to ashes, he’d still be able to recognize those three words.
He would never forget the dirty, lowly thing that the well-dressed man did!
So the woman he noticed today who made him feel so peaceful was Cheng Weiguo’s daughter?
He heard Cheng Weiguo only had that one daughter who he loved so dearly.
He Jichen creased his brows a little harder. “What the hell’s wrong?”
Han Zhifan snapped back to his senses and realized that he was lost for a moment and hurriedly pushed down the feelings in his eyes. He looked up at He Jichen and shot him his usual warm smile. “Nothing, I was just shocked. I never imagined that such a hidden gem would be on your production team!”
He Jichen believed Han Zhifan, so he didn’t pursue it any further.
Seeing as He Jichen looked normal and didn’t pick up on anything, Han Zhifan felt more at ease. Then he looked down to hide the boiling emotions in his eyes.
Cheng Weiguo, Cheng Weiwan, Cheng Weiwan, Cheng Weiguo…
He repeated those two names in his mind over and over again until he eventually gritted his teeth with hatred and ferocity.
In this lifetime, he would never forgive Cheng Weiguo. He had been waiting for an opportunity to give Cheng Weiguo a fate worse than death… With Cheng Weiwan’s appearance, this might just be that opportunity for him.
At that thought, Han Zhifan lost interest in lounging around in He Jichen’s room. “It’s getting late, so I’m heading back to my room to get some rest.”
He Jichen nodded slightly. He didn’t try to make Han Zhifan stay, but he remembered something the moment that he got up and cried to Han Zhifan, “Ah yeah!”
“Mm?” Han Zhifan stopped everything he was doing and stared at He Jichen.
He Jichen raised his head and downed the red wine then glanced over at Han Zhifan and said in a dull voice, “I have to stay on set and can’t step away, so there’s something I wanted to ask of you.”
“What is it? Just say it and it’s done.”
“Go back to Beijing and help me find out which hospital Ji Yi had her abortion done at three years ago…” Back in Ji Yi’s room, he heard Qian Ge mention how Ji Yi almost lost her life during her abortion years ago. If it really happened how Qian Ge described it, why would she risk so much to avoid having his child? Could there possibly be some kind of hidden reason he didn’t know about?
At that thought, He Jichen added, “Remember, I want the most comprehensive rundown of what happened.”
“Alright,” promised Han Zhifan. Seeing as He Jichen had no other orders, he said goodbye and left.
The door gently opened and shut, suddenly causing the room to fall incredibly silent. Now there was only He Jichen left in the room.
He sat on the sofa for quite some time before the alarm on his phone rang. He finally got up and walked out of the bedroom.
Because of the wound on his hand, He Jichen went to the restroom to quickly freshen up before he laid back in bed.
A hard object under his body felt a little uncomfortable. He furrowed his brows and pulled out the hard object. It was He Yuguang’s phone.

Chapter 75: Deal With The Devil
“Spill it. Since you went through all the effort of taking me here, what do you want from me? Is it money? Or is it something else?”
“You’ll know soon enough.”
The young man smiled and gestured for Dlamini to follow him. “Sir, your children are waiting for you. Please come with me —”
Dlamini got up with a drab expression on his face. The moment he tried to take a step, he felt his legs going limp for a split second and nearly fell onto the floor on all fours.
“It’s alright, it’s just the side effect of the stun grenade and anesthetics. It’ll pass in a few days.”
The young man remarked without the slightest intention of helping Dlamini up.
Dlamini clenched his teeth bitterly and forced his stony body to get up. He used the wall for support as he headed outside.
It was only until Dlamini walked out when he realized the room that he was in was the bedroom of a suite. He had now walked into the living room of the suite.
“Godfather!”
“Lord Godfather!”
In the living room, two young men immediately greeted Dlamini when they saw him and helped him get seated on the couch.
In that instant, Dlamini felt mildly touched. He shook his head to let them know that he was fine.
“Clap!”
“Clap!”
“Clap!”
Upon witnessing the scene before him, Chen Chen could not stop himself from breaking out into a smile full of mockery. He applauded slowly and said, “What a heartwarming picture displaying the love between father and son… There’s a saying in Italy that went like this —
“The Italians think that the world is far too dangerous a place for young children in the midst of their development. To better cultivate their young, they need to have two fatherly figures in their lives. And that was how the term godfather came to be. I wonder if you guys share the same ideal?”
“That’s right.” Dlamini looked up upon hearing Chen Chen’s remark. “Jack and Ryan are both children of my loyal brothers who have died for my cause. I brought them up with my own two hands. They are my dearest family and assistant.”
“I see…”
The mockery hanging by the corner of the young man’s lips grew ever wider. He turned to the two men and asked while making exaggerated gestures with his hands, “What do you guys think? Is Mr. Dlamini here your dearest family?”
The young men named Jack and Ryan felt a shiver creeping down their spines and immediately turned their heads to the ground.
“What do you mean?” Dlamini asked, frowning.
“Here are some recordings we obtained recently.” The young man retrieved a recording pen from his pocket and presented it in front of him. He turned it on.
The recording pen immediately played back a previous conversation. In the recording, the young man asked the questions while the other two answered them accordingly. The answers they provided consisted of all sorts of secrets concerning Dlamini.
“You two…” A flash of anger appeared in Dlamini’s eyes just after listening to a small part of the recording. He wanted to scream bloody murder but when he thought about his current circumstances, the only thing that came out was a bitter smile before he slumped back into the couch.
This time around, he hardly had the strength left to sit upright.
“There’s still a chance for you guys to come out of this alive,” the young man announced suddenly.
The three of them raised their heads in unison.
The young man smirked before revealing a Glock 18C from behind his back. He held the gun by its barrel and presented it before the three men.
The three of them were slightly taken aback by the sudden development.
“Can it be any more obvious?”
The young man held the gun even closer to them and spoke in a grumbling, hypnotizing tone, “All you guys have to do is take this gun and point to my head — Bang. Just like that, you’re free!”
Jake and Ryan exchanged a glance with each other. They had trouble grasping the young man’s true intentions.
“What is it, too afraid to do it? What are you, afraid of the people backing me?” The young man made a show of turning around to look at his subordinate standing guard in the corner. “Cheng Cao, why don’t you head out first and don’t come back unless I ordered you to.”
“Yes, Boss.” The man called Cheng Cao promptly opened the door and walked out of the room without the slightest bit of hesitation.
“Look. Nobody is watching you now.”
The young man turned around and held the gun closer. It was almost hovering right in front of one of the man’s faces now. “Take it, hurry up. Be a man.”
The man named Jack took the gun hesitantly.
“Alright. Next, take off the safety and aim it between my eyes.”
The young man grabbed the gun still held by Jack and directed it between his eyes. He then proceeded to raise his hands and wiggle his fingers to show that he was left completely unguarded.
Jack blinked uncontrollably and seemed to be hesitating.
“Shoot?”
The young man made a show of laughing in their faces, his eyes were like the mouths leading to a depthless abyss. “Don’t tell me you don’t have the guts to pull the trigger? You call yourselves the mafia and when you don’t even have what it takes to pull a trigger?”
In this split instant, there was an abrupt change in Jack’s eyes. In a swift motion, he rapidly took the gun off its safety and pulled the trigger with all the force he could muster!
All of his previous hesitations were merely an act!
However, something bizarre occurred!
In the very instant he pulled the trigger to kill the strange young man before him, he was taken unaware by a strange sensation that felt like he had lost control over his right arm.
“What, what’s going on?”Jack looked at his right hand in astonishment as he saw his fingers slowly releasing the trigger. At the same time, he felt a numbing sensation in his elbow while his arm seemed to move with a conscience of its own.
“Jack, what are you doing?” Ryan cried out beside him.
“I, I don’t know?”Jack was almost bawling at this point. He quickly tried to pin down his right arm with his left arm, but the moment he tried to raise his left arm, it disobediently slumped down yet again.
He had lost control of his left arm as well!
What happened next was an image that Dlamini and Ryan would never be able to forget for the rest of their lives – What they witnessed was Jack’s arm bending in an unsettling angle, his wrists seemed to violently twist themselves around and pointed the Glock right at his head!
“Stop this right now, Jack!” Ryan exclaimed.
“I can’t stop, help me!” Jack’s face was painted with horror. He kept trying to crane his waist and neck in a feeble attempt to dodge the gun pointed at him. Immediately afterward, he lost complete control over every part of his body!
In the end, Jack, with his eyes swarmed with horror, beheld the pitch-black barrel pointed directly at him…
Following the sound of a gunshot, a bullet-shaped tunnel was carved between both ends of Jack’s temples.
Witnessing the freakish occurrence, Ryan, who was standing beside him, let loose a horrific scream. After that, something stranger happened – despite having his brain matter blended into a mixture of paste by the bullet, Jack’s body remained standing in place!
As if that was not enough, he extended his arm and presented the gun in front of Ryan.
“You’re the devil!” Ryan screeched in horror. He snatched the gun faster than he could blink and shot at the young man!
The very next second, he realized his body was frozen as well…
“Bang!” Another gunshot. Ryan’s head slumped down meekly. A bullet hole the size of a fist appeared on his forehead. Similarly, his arm popped forward freakishly to present the gun in front of Dlamini.
It was like some sort of relay race of death…
“Witchery? Or is this the work of some form of advanced technology?”
Dlamini’s eyes were wide open as he stared at the gun passed to him in disbelief. He could not help but form the connection with the wound on the back of Indell’s and his neck.
He glanced at the back of Jack and Ryan’s neck who remained standing. On the back of their necks was a similar-sized tiny wound.
As expected…
Sadly, it was too late finding out now.
At this moment, Dlamini realized he had completely lost control of his body. It was as if his body was possessed by another soul and he could only helplessly watch as the spirit controlled his body. He watched himself take the gun that had already claimed two victims. He watched as he aimed it at his head.
With death approaching closer, Dlamini slowly shut his eyes.
“Click!” Dlamini felt himself trembling.
Unexpectedly, death did not claim him. As it turned out, there was no third bullet.
“A mistake? No, he never planned to kill me, otherwise, that would defeat the purpose of kidnapping me…”
Dlamini could not help but utter a bitter laugh. To think that he had forgotten to consider something as basic as that, seemed like his age was catching up to him.
“How does it feel?” Again, the young man standing beside him asked in that nonchalant tone of his, “Do you feel the exciting rush of being reborn again?”
“You’re the devil incarnate!” Dlamini wearily collapsed on the ground and surrendered. “You win. You’ve trampled all over my dignity and my pride into meek pieces, you’ve achieved your goal!” Arriving at this point, he found himself regaining complete control over his body.
“Mr. Dlamini is overstating things,” At this point, the young man seemed to finally get serious. He walked in front of Dlamini and said looking down at him, “Dlamini, there’s something of yours I want to borrow.”
“What do you want?” Dlamini asked weakly.
“I want to borrow your Eiffel Thermal Power Plant for several days.”
“Alright, the Eiffel Thermal Power Plant is yours.” Dlamini agreed without hesitation. “What else?”
“I’m sorry, I believe you might have understood what I meant.”
The young man wagged his finger and squatted down next to him. “I don’t need ownership of your power plant. I already said ‘borrow for several days’.”
“I understand what you meant…”
Dlamini shook his head when he heard the young man. “It’s not gonna work, the power plant is responsible for supplying energy to more than a good half of Cape Town. Even though I have complete rights to the power plant, I simply don’t have the authority to direct the power to another city. The city hall won’t let me do that.”
“Who told you that I was going to direct it to another place?”
Instead, the young man responded with a smile. “You don’t have to worry about where the electric is going to, there’s just one thing you need to do for me.”
After that, the young man headed toward the door as he continued. “I only need you to deal with the pressure from ‘upstairs’.”
“Pressure, you’re talking about the officials?” Dlamini took a sharp breath.
